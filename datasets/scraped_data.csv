BlackRock and Microsoft plan $30bn fund to invest in AI infrastructure,"  
[https://www.ft.com/content/4441114b-a105-439c-949b-1e7f81517deb](https://www.ft.com/content/4441114b-a105-439c-949b-1e7f81517deb)

BlackRock is preparing to launch a more than $30bn artificial intelligence investment fund with technology giant Microsoft to build data centres and energy projects to meet growing demands stemming from AI.  

The financial partnership, which BlackRock is launching with its new infrastructure investment unit, Global Infrastructure Partners, would be one of the biggest investment vehicles ever raised on Wall Street. Microsoft and MGX, the Abu Dhabi-backed investment company, are general partners in the fund. Nvidia, the fast-growing chipmaker, will advise on factory design and integration. 

The investment vehicle is aimed at addressing the staggering power and digital infrastructure demands of building AI products that are expected to face severe capacity bottlenecks in coming years. The computing power of AI requires far more energy than previous technological innovations and has strained existing energy infrastructure. 

Dubbed the Global AI Investment Partnership, the effort seeks to raise up to $30bn in equity investments and leverage that to support up to an additional $70bn in debt financing. 

The fund would mark GIP’s first big fund since the private infrastructure investment group agreed to be acquired by BlackRock for $12.5bn earlier this year. That deal is due to close in October.

BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, has highlighted the energy sector as one of its top opportunities for growth. “Mobilising private capital to build AI infrastructure like data centres and power will unlock a multitrillion-dollar long-term investment opportunity,” Larry Fink, BlackRock chief executive, said in a statement.

The soon-to-be launched fund is the latest vehicle created by a large asset manager to meet the ever-growing demand for energy to power generative AI and cloud computing. Earlier this year Microsoft agreed to back $10bn in renewable electricity projects built by Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management. Microsoft has made a commitment to ensure 100 per cent of its energy consumption is matched by zero carbon energy purchases by 2030.  

“The country and the world are going to need more capital investment to accelerate the development of the AI infrastructure needed. This kind of effort is an important step,” said Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president. 

MGX was created earlier this year with the backing of Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala to advance the country’s progress in AI. It has been in talks to invest in Open AI’s next funding round. 

In 2017, Blackstone announced plans for a $40bn infrastructure vehicle with backing from Saudi Arabia, and Brookfield last year raised $28bn for what was described as the largest ever infrastructure fund. 

The International Energy Agency estimates that global electricity consumption by data centres could surpass 1,000 terawatt-hours by 2026, more than twice the amount used in 2022.  Recommended LexBig Tech Data centres have turned Big Tech into big spenders Premium content 

“Accelerated computing and generative AI are driving a growing need for AI infrastructure for the next industrial revolution,” Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s founder, said in a statement. 

In the US, which hosts one-third of the world’s data centres, electricity demand is rising rapidly for the first time in two decades, driven partly by these energy-intensive facilities. A report from Grid Strategies indicates that five-year projections for electricity demand growth in the US have nearly doubled over the past year, increasing from 2.6 per cent to 4.7 per cent. 

“There is a clear need to mobilise significant amounts of private capital to fund investments in essential infrastructure,” Bayo Ogunlesi, GIP’s chief executive, said in a

(9/18) - Wednesday's Pre-Market News & Stock Movers,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Wednesday, September the 18th, 2024-

# [Stock futures rise slightly as traders debate how big the Fed’s anticipated rate cut will be: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/17/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose slightly Wednesday as Wall Street anticipated the first Federal Reserve interest rate cut in four years. Gains were muted as uncertainty lingered over how big the easing will be from the central bank.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 36 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures advanced 0.2% each.
*****
> The Fed is expected to deliver its latest policy decision at 2 p.m. ET. The central bank is expected to lower rates by at least a quarter percentage point, but traders are divided over how big the reduction will be. CME Group’s FedWatch tool shows traders pricing in a 65% chance of a half-point cut and 35% odds of a quarter-point move.
*****
> It’s unusual to have this much uncertainty into a Fed decision as the central bank typically tries to telegraph its next move to the markets. Traders had believed for most of the last month that the Fed would lower by a quarter point, but the idea of a super-sized cut began to gain traction in the past week.
*****
> “You’d have to go back over 15 years to find such an uncertain situation this close to the decision. A lot of money will be made and lost today,” Jim Reid, Deutsche Bank head of global economics and thematic research, wrote in a Wednesday note.
*****
> The ushering in of a cutting cycle is expected to shore up a stalling economy and further boost an already strong market, with the S&P 500 at a record following an 18% gain this year. The benchmark has averaged gains of about 16% in the 12 months following the first cut, according to data from Canaccord Genuity.
*****
> Despite these market expectations, some investors remain cautious about cutting rates too much, too soon. Peter Cecchini, Axonic Capital’s director of research, called a 50 basis point cut “unusual” as the first move in a cutting cycle from the Fed given the current state of the housing market.
*****
> “This is not really the environment where I think the Fed needs to do a 50 basis point cut as a preemptive measure, when historically it’s never done so,” he told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a mixed session that saw the S&P 500 edge up 0.03% after notching another all-time high during intraday trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 16 points, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.2%.

"Canada's inflation cools to 2% in Aug, reaches central bank's target","Referencing to Canada's case, inflation target has been reached with only 75bps interest rate cuts ...

What action will be taken by Fed in September? 25bps or 50bps?

Furthermore, is it realistic to continue pricing in 100bps to 125bps interest rate cuts until end of 2024?

&#x200B;

**Canada's inflation cools to 2% in Aug, reaches central bank's target**

[https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canadas-inflation-cools-2-aug-reaches-central-banks-target-2024-09-17](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canadas-inflation-cools-2-aug-reaches-central-banks-target-2024-09-17)

&#x200B;

*Summary*

* *Core price measures eases to a 40-month low in Aug*
* *Consumer prices deflate in Aug on a monthly basis*
* *Rents rise by 8.9% in Aug from 8.5% in July*

&#x200B;

*Canada's annual inflation rate reached the central bank's target in August at it cooled to 2%, its lowest level since February 2021, data showed on Tuesday.*

*The closely watched core price measures also cooled to their lowest level in 40 months while month-on-month consumer prices deflated by 0.2%, Statistics Canada said.*

*Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast the consumer price index (CPI) to cool to 2.1% from 2.5% in July on an annual basis, and expected it to be unchanged on a monthly basis.*

*The easing of price pressures was primarily helped by a drop in prices of gasoline, telephone services and clothing and footwear, while shelter costs - mortgage and rents - continued to cool at a tepid pace as rents continued their relentless rise.*

*At the Bank of Canada's monetary policy decision announcement earlier this month Governor Tiff Macklem had said the bank has to increasingly guard against the risk that inflation could fall below its target as economic growth was weak.*

*The BoC has reduced its key policy rate three times in a row from June, cutting by a cumulative 75 basis point to 4.25%.*

*Money markets are fully pricing in 25 basis point rate cuts twice in as many monetary policy meetings remaining in the year, but economists say that chances of a jumbo 50 basis point cut this year is gradually building up.*

*The BoC had predicted annual inflation to be at 2.6% this year and fall to 2.4% next year before coming down to its mid-point of the target range of 1-3% in 2026.*

*CPI-median - or the price change located in the middle of the CPI basket - slowed to 2.3% in August from 2.4% in July annually. CPI-trim - which excludes the most and the least volatile price items - cooled to 2.4% from 2.7%.*

*Gasoline prices, which contributed the most to the fall in inflation, fell by 5.1% and clothing and footwear fell by 4.4%.*

*Shelter costs, which accounts for close to 30% of the CPI basket, rose by 5.2% in August, from 5.7% in July, primarily led by rents which rose by 8.9% from 8.5% in July.*",173,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fiybfh/canadas_inflation_cools_to_2_in_aug_reaches/,referencing canada case inflation target reached bps interest rate cut action taken fed september bps bps furthermore realistic continue pricing bps bps interest rate cut end xb canada inflation cool aug reach central bank target xb summary core price measure ea month low aug consumer price deflate aug monthly basis rent rise aug july xb canada annual inflation rate reached central bank target august cooled lowest level since february data showed tuesday closely watched core price measure also cooled lowest level month monthonmonth consumer price deflated statistic canada said analyst polled reuters forecast consumer price index cpi cool july annual basis expected unchanged monthly basis easing price pressure primarily helped drop price gasoline telephone service clothing footwear shelter cost mortgage rent continued cool tepid pace rent continued relentless rise bank canada monetary policy decision announcement earlier month governor tiff macklem said bank increasingly guard risk inflation could fall target economic growth weak boc reduced key policy rate three time row june cutting cumulative basis point money market fully pricing basis point rate cut twice many monetary policy meeting remaining year economist say chance jumbo basis point cut year gradually building boc predicted annual inflation year fall next year coming midpoint target range cpimedian price change located middle cpi basket slowed august july annually cpitrim excludes least volatile price item cooled gasoline price contributed fall inflation fell clothing footwear fell shelter cost account close cpi basket rose august july primarily led rent rose july,canada inflation cool to in aug reach central bank target,canada inflation cool to in aug reach central bank target referencing canada case inflation target reached bps interest rate cut action taken fed september bps bps furthermore realistic continue pricing bps bps interest rate cut end xb canada inflation cool aug reach central bank target xb summary core price measure ea month low aug consumer price deflate aug monthly basis rent rise aug july xb canada annual inflation rate reached central bank target august cooled lowest level since february data showed tuesday closely watched core price measure also cooled lowest level month monthonmonth consumer price deflated statistic canada said analyst polled reuters forecast consumer price index cpi cool july annual basis expected unchanged monthly basis easing price pressure primarily helped drop price gasoline telephone service clothing footwear shelter cost mortgage rent continued cool tepid pace rent continued relentless rise bank canada monetary policy decision announcement earlier month governor tiff macklem said bank increasingly guard risk inflation could fall target economic growth weak boc reduced key policy rate three time row june cutting cumulative basis point money market fully pricing basis point rate cut twice many monetary policy meeting remaining year economist say chance jumbo basis point cut year gradually building boc predicted annual inflation year fall next year coming midpoint target range cpimedian price change located middle cpi basket slowed august july annually cpitrim excludes least volatile price item cooled gasoline price contributed fall inflation fell clothing footwear fell shelter cost account close cpi basket rose august july primarily led rent rose july,positive
How would you value Coinbase?,"For starters, I think the difference in price and value with Coinbase stock is huge. I keep seeing it mentioned as 'cheap' because of the 30x P/E ratio. But that is way off.

Here are a few key metrics showing conflicting signals:

1. The stock is trading at a $40b market cap with \~$3b in annual sales. Earnings are very volatile and cash flows are inconsistent.
2. The business is asset-light but the custody assets are consistently growing on the balance sheet. They've gone from $2b to $200b in custody assets over five years.

I know this is a momentum stock in many ways. Even though the crypto hype has slowed down, prices have doubled since last year. More money chasing fewer assets.

$160 per share is rich. The stock price can get cut in half and I would still think it's expensive. But they have somehow combined 3-4 very valuable business models: a financial exchange, custody assets, software products and asset management.

I don't care for the typical valuation methods. Not even comparables are applicable here. Only ICE, Nasdaq, CBOE and CMOE are similar but each has a different specialty. Even sum-of-parts would be interesting but would require constant updates. Which is useless because crypto momentum and volatility have a life of their own.

Tell me how you would value this stock. What would you need to see to de-risk this as an investment?

P.S. Coinbase has been on my radar because of the recent regulatory progress. Their legal team is crushing it. First, they're spending \~$20m YTD to provide more clarity for investors. Second, this will secure their leadership position along with some regulatory capture. It's a winning position from my perspective.

"Received $85,000 recently. Should we put it in an ETF such as S&P500 right now or wait?","Hi Everyone 
I received around $85,000 recently as a back payment for a long term consultancy assignment I was working. Instead of spending it, I was thinking of saving it on the side for the future. Now the question - should I put the amount in an ETF right now such as S&P 500. I’m skeptical of the stock market these days considering it’s already overvalued and the risk of an impending recession but then I also get a FOMO.

U.S. Awards Intel $3 Billion for Military Supply Program,"The Biden administration announced on Monday that it would award Intel up to $3 billion to expand the company’s manufacturing of advanced semiconductors for the U.S. military.

The program, called Secure Enclave, aims to create a trusted source of computer chips for the U.S. government. It will be funded out of a pool of money from the 2022 bipartisan CHIPS Act, which lawmakers passed in an attempt to reduce the nation’s dependence on foreign sources of semiconductors.

Much of the world’s semiconductors are currently made in Asia, particularly Taiwan. China claims the island as its own territory, a position that Taiwan rejects, and American officials have long had concerns about the consequences for the U.S. economy and military if China were to invade Taiwan.

Intel officials said on Monday that the company would help “secure the domestic chip supply chain” and work with federal officials to “enhance the resilience of U.S. technological systems.”

The announcement comes about six months after the Biden administration awarded Intel a grant of up to $8.5 billion to help the company fund major construction projects in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon. That money, along with the award announced Monday, stems from a $39 billion pot of CHIPS Act funding intended to encourage companies to build and expand semiconductor plants across the United States.

Federal officials also awarded Intel up to $11 billion in loans, and the company is expected to claim federal tax credits that could cover 25 percent of its U.S. expansion projects, which are expected to cost more than $100 billion over five years.

"Intel stock jumps on plan to turn foundry unit into subsidiary, allow outside funding","Intel shares jumped almost 10% in extended trading on Monday after the company said it plans to turn its foundry business into an independent unit with its own board and the potential to raise outside capital.

As part of CEO Pat Gelsinger’s effort to turn around the struggling chipmaker, Intel said in a memo to employees that it will also sell off part of its stake in Altera.

Gelsinger said the restructuring would allow Foundry to “evaluate independent sources of funding,” and comes days after Intel’s board met to assess the direction and future of the company. The foundry business, which Intel plans to use to manufacture chips for other customers, has been a big drag on its bottom line, with the company spending roughly $25 billion on it for the last two years.

Beyond just considering outside funding, Intel is weighing whether to spin off the foundry business, possibly into a separate publicly traded company, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who declined to be named to discuss confidential information.

With a standalone “operating board” and a cleaner corporate structure, the mechanics of a separation become far easier than trying to turn a fully-integrated unit into a separate company.

Intel has lost almost 60% of its value this year, as the company has lost market share in its core PC and data center market and watched Nvidia run away with the market for chips that power artificial intelligence workloads. Last month, Intel reported disappointing quarterly results, sparking the sharpest selloff in 50 years, and said it would lay off over 15% of its workforce as part of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan.

Intel will also pause its fab efforts in Poland and Germany “by approximately two years based on anticipated market demand,” Gelsinger said. The chipmaker will also pull back on its plans for its Malaysian factory. U.S. manufacturing projects will remain unaffected, the company said.

The company is also roughly halfway towards the layoffs announced in August, Gelsinger said.

Intel also announced on Monday that it had entered into a deal with Amazon Web Services to produce custom chips for AI.

The move is a vote of confidence in Intel’s quest to manufacture custom chips for companies in its foundry business, in addition to designing its own products.

It extends a long-running partnership between the two companies. Amazon is a large end customer of Intel chips to power its AWS servers, and will buy a custom Xeon processor from Intel as well, Intel said.

It also will allow Intel a new foothold in the growing industry for AI server chips. While Intel has several products that can be used for AI, including one called Gaudi 3, Nvidia has largely taken control of the market.

Amazon has developed its own AI chips, including one called Trainium, for over five years. Companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have invested heavily in custom chips to run AI in hopes that theirs would be less expensive or offer other advantages over than Nvidia’s general-purpose GPUs.

The company said that the chips would be made on the company’s 18A process, which is expected to be used in production in 2025. Analysts expect the manufacturing technology to be similar to TSMC’s forthcoming 2nm process. (The first chips using TSMC’s 3nm process are shipping now in Apple’s iPhone.)

Intel said that it would perform its most advanced manufacturing, including the AI chip for AWS, at its plant in Ohio that’s currently under construction.

“All eyes will remain on us. We need to fight for every inch and execute better than ever before. Because that’s the only way to quiet our critics and deliver the results we know we’re capable of achieving,” Gelsinger said.

(DD) Limoneira - LMNR - Citrus fruits and Real Estate. Two things that will continue to go up in price.,"Alright, listen up—**Limoneira Co. (LMNR)** is more than just another agribusiness. This company is strategically positioned in multiple growth sectors with a solid balance of core revenue and serious upside potential. Let’s get into the technicals:

# Company Snapshot

* **Ticker**: LMNR
* **Sector**: Agribusiness, Real Estate Development, Renewable Energy
* **Core Focus**: Limoneira is one of the largest producers of lemons in the U.S. and globally. On top of that, they’ve diversified into real estate development and solar energy, creating multiple revenue streams.
* **Market Cap**: \~$450-500 million (a small-cap with room to run)
* **Founded**: 1893 (These guys aren’t new to the game, and their longevity speaks to strong fundamentals)

# Strategic Advantages

# A. Dominant Player in Citrus Production

* **Lemons & Avocados**: Limoneira owns about over 12,000 acres of farmland across California, Arizona, and Chile. That’s huge. They’re a major supplier of lemons, with a foothold in high-margin markets. They're essentially what replaced the Florida citrus industry. The global demand for citrus—especially lemons—is growing due to health trends, and Limoneira is well-positioned to capitalize.
* **Vertical Integration**: The company controls its supply chain—farming, packing, and marketing—which maximizes margins and improves operational efficiency. Limoneira isn’t just a grower; they manage their product from farm to table, cutting down on costs and giving them more control over pricing.
* **HLB Disease Wiping out Competition**: Buckle up, this point is going to be a bit controversial. HLB (Huanglongbing) is a disease that was responsible for the collapse of the Florida citrus industry and is actively killing citrus farms worldwide. Limoneira remains unaffected by HLB to this day, and appears to be at the forefront of HLB prevention. They're ahead of the curve and has had the luxury of time to develop various methods to secure HLB prevention. This means that citrus supply is decreasing worldwide while Limoneira is one of the very few companies that can meet growing demands. Citrus products get pricier, Limoneira makes more profit.

# B. Real Estate as a Long-Term Growth Catalyst

* **Harvest at Limoneira**: This is where the big money’s going to come from. They’re developing a 1,500-home community on prime California real estate. Over time, this project is expected to generate significant cash flow and push earnings higher. If you like steady long-term gains, real estate adds a substantial value to their portfolio.
* **Land Appreciation**: Limoneira’s holding tons of land across high-demand regions. As real estate prices keep climbing in California and Arizona, this land is an undervalued asset sitting on their balance sheet. That’s baked-in value that hasn’t fully been realized yet by the market.

C. **Sustainability and Renewable Energy**

* **Solar Energy Investments**: Limoneira has made strategic investments in solar power, reducing their energy costs and boosting their environmental profile. In an age where ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) matters more than ever, Limoneira’s ahead of the curve.
* **Water Conservation**: Given California’s ongoing water challenges, Limoneira’s focus on water efficiency adds a key operational edge. Their ability to sustain production through efficient water use is crucial in maintaining stable margins and addressing regulatory concerns.

# Financial Performance

# A. Revenue Growth and Stability

* **Consistent Cash Flow**: Despite the cyclical nature of agriculture, Limoneira has maintained steady revenue. Their diversified operations—agriculture, real estate, renewable energy—create a solid foundation for consistent cash flow. Citrus production alone has shown strong demand resilience, with premium pricing power in high-end markets.

# B. Real Estate Boost to Earnings

* **Massive Upside from Harvest Project**: Harvest at Limoneira is expected to deliver serious returns. While the agricultural side of the business keeps things stable, this real estate project could drive significant EPS growth over the next few years as homes are built and sold. We’re talking hundreds of millions in potential revenue over the life of the project.

# C. Balance Sheet

* **Land Holdings**: Their real estate holdings are a huge hidden asset. The market hasn’t fully priced in the long-term value of these assets. This land is strategically located in high-demand areas—prime for development as housing demand grows in California.
* **Low Debt Levels**: Limoneira has maintained manageable debt, which is crucial for a company balancing real estate projects and agribusiness. Their debt load is aligned with their growth strategy, and they’ve got the flexibility to expand without straining their balance sheet.

# Growth Catalysts

# A. Global Citrus Demand

* **Rising Consumption**: The global demand for citrus, particularly lemons, is growing due to increasing health consciousness and their use in beverages, food, and cosmetics. Limoneira’s strong export presence gives them international growth potential, particularly in emerging markets like Asia, where demand is expanding rapidly.

# B. Real Estate Development

* **Ongoing Project Phases**: As they continue to develop Harvest at Limoneira, you’ll start seeing big one-time revenue bumps when properties are sold. And remember, this isn’t just a one-and-done project—there’s room for expansion and more developments once this is complete.

# C. Sustainability Trends

* **ESG Investing**: More institutional investors are pouring capital into companies with strong ESG profiles, and Limoneira’s solar energy investments and sustainable farming practices make them a prime candidate. This could lead to increased demand for their stock as more ESG funds look to invest in companies like Limoneira.

# Valuation Metrics

* **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio**: Limoneira’s P/B ratio is currently sitting at a point that suggests its assets—especially their real estate holdings—are undervalued. As the market begins to fully realize the potential of their land and real estate projects, we could see significant multiple expansion.
* **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**: Their current P/E might seem high for an agribusiness, but remember—this isn’t just an agriculture play. As real estate revenues kick in, that P/E is likely to drop significantly, boosting the stock price.

# Risks (Bear Case)

# A. Agricultural Volatility

* **Weather Dependency**: Agriculture always has risks related to weather—drought, storms, etc. But Limoneira mitigates this with geographically diverse farmland, spreading their risk across multiple regions and climates.
* **Labor Costs**: California’s rising labor costs could pressure margins, but Limoneira’s diversified revenue streams and operational efficiencies help cushion against this. 
* **Immigration Policy:** Relating to labor costs, the company does appear to rely on cheap labor supply, which are largely migrant workers. Any immigration policy that greatly impacts the ability for migrants to work in the farming industry would mean Limoneira would take a hit in terms of costs. They largely have automated the packing process, but harvest automation is still in the works and likely will not be viable in the near future.
* **HLB:** The possibility of this disease hitting Limoneira's farms are definitely not zero, this is partially why they're diversifying their cash flow with avocados, energy, and real estate.

# B. Real Estate Market Fluctuations

* **California Market Risks**: While housing demand is strong, any downturn in the California real estate market could delay profits from the Harvest project. That said, they’re in regions with steady demand, so a major downturn seems unlikely in the near future.

# Conclusion

* **Diversified Revenue Streams**: Limoneira’s balanced mix of high-demand agriculture (lemons, avocados), long-term real estate development, and sustainability initiatives makes them a versatile play. You’ve got both short-term and long-term growth potential here.
* **Undervalued Real Estate**: The real estate projects aren’t fully priced into the stock right now. When those revenues start hitting, the upside potential could be substantial. Limoneira’s land holdings are a massive asset that’s flying under the radar for many investors.
* **Sustainability Focus**: ESG-focused investing is growing, and Limoneira’s renewable energy initiatives and water conservation efforts make them an attractive target for those big ESG funds looking for solid companies in agriculture and real estate.

(9/17) - Tuesday's Pre-Market News & Stock Movers,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Tuesday, September the 17th, 2024-

# [Stock futures rise as Wall Street awaits retail sales data, Fed policy meeting: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/16/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose Tuesday as Wall Street readied for key retail sales data and the start of the Federal Reserve’s September policy meeting.
*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500 added 0.4%, while Nasdaq-100 futures gained 0.6%. Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 131 points, or 0.3%.
*****
> Microsoft rose 2% after the tech giant hiked its quarterly dividend by 10.7% to 83 cents per share. The company also approved a $60 billion buyback program.
*****
> Intel shares popped about 7% in premarket trading after the company said it plans to make its foundry business a subsidiary. The Biden administration also awarded the company up to $3 billion in funding through the Chips Act.
*****
> Investors on Tuesday will parse retail sales data for August for one final glimpse into the health of the U.S. consumer ahead of the Fed rate decision. Economists polled by Dow Jones are bracing for a 0.2% decline. Excluding autos, they see a 0.2% gain. The results could affect the rate cut outcome.
*****
> Wall Street is on standby for the Fed’s long-anticipated rate cut, a move that could help boost earnings growth for companies following a backdrop of steep borrowing costs and high inflation. The Fed first embarked on its aggressive hiking campaign in March 2022.
*****
> While Wall Street expects a cut Wednesday, the market is divided on the size of the potential reduction. Traders are currently pricing in a 67% chance that the central bank eases rates by 50 basis points, according to CME Group’s Fed Watch tool. That’s up from a roughly 47% chance Friday.
*****
> “Market expectations are split between a 25 basis point and a 50 basis point rate cut, as the decision is complicated by conflicting signals of solid economic activity but a weakening labor market,” said Principal Asset Management’s Seema Shah. “Rarely have market expectations been so torn, so close to a [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting.”
*****
> While a 50 basis point cut isn’t out of the question, the chief global strategist thinks that the Fed should take a more cautious approach to cutting and ease rates by 25 basis points. She is forecasting additional 25 basis point cuts in November and December.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a mixed trading session. The 30-stock Dow rose more than 228 points, or 0.55%, to close at a record high, while the S&P 500 added 0.13%. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.52% as Apple and prominent chip stocks declined.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Boeing freezes hiring in sweeping cost cuts as it grapples with factory worker strike,"Boeing announced sweeping cost cuts including a hiring freeze and a pause on nonessential staff travel to preserve cash as it deals with a strike of more than 30,000 factory workers..

Boeing factory workers, mostly in the Seattle area, started walking off the job early Friday after overwhelmingly rejecting a tentative labor deal and to strike.

“We are working in good faith to reach a new contract agreement that reflects their feedback and enables operations to resume,” CFO Brian West said in a staff note on Monday. ” However, our business is in a difficult period. This strike jeopardizes our recovery in a significant way and we must take necessary actions to preserve cash and safeguard our shared future.”

The financial impact of the strike will depend on how long it lasts but Boeing is focused on conserving cash, West said at a Morgan Stanley conference Friday. He said the company’s new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, wants to get back to the bargaining table right away to reach a new deal.

On Friday, Moody’s put all of Boeing’s credit ratings on review for a downgrade and Fitch Ratings said a prolonged strike could put Boeing at risk of a downgrade. That could drive up the borrowing costs of a manufacturer that already has mounting debt.

Boeing burned about $8 billion in the first half of the year as production slowed in the wake of a near-catastrophic door-panel blowout at the start of the year.

FDA clears Apple’s sleep apnea detection feature for use. Here’s how it works,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday cleared Apple
’s new sleep apnea detection feature for use, which means it will come to the Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Ultra 2 later this month. 

Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder that causes a person’s breathing to repeatedly stop and start throughout the night. The condition affects more than 30 million people in the U.S., but only around 6 million are diagnosed, according to the American Medical Association. If it goes untreated, sleep apnea can cause fatigue and lead to more serious health issues like heart problems, hypertension and Type 2 diabetes. 

“We are so excited about the incredible impact this feature can make for the millions of people living with undiagnosed sleep apnea,” Dr. Sumbul Desai, vice president of health at Apple, said in the feature’s launch video.

Apple’s sleep apnea detection feature marks the company’s latest attempt to position its wearables as a cheaper, simpler alternative to many existing health-care tests and devices. And the sleep disorder market could prove to be lucrative. 

To get evaluated for sleep apnea, for instance, patients typically participate in an at-home test or an in-lab test where they’re monitored overnight. Prices vary depending on insurance coverage, but the average in-lab test costs $3,000, according to a 2022 study in the Journal of Primary Care & Community Health. 

At-home tests are often less expensive, but they can still cost hundreds of dollars. The at-home sleep apnea test from Sleep Doctor costs $189, for example. Apple’s newest watch, the Series 10, starts at $399. 

Apple’s sleep apnea detection feature is “potentially a game changer” for patients who have been reluctant to seek out testing, said Dr. David Kuhlmann, a physician who has treated sleep disorders for nearly two decades in Missouri. Kuhlmann also serves on the board of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, which is a professional society for sleep medicine clinicians.  

Kuhlmann said the feature could be especially helpful for patients who sleep alone, and he thinks a lot of people will be surprised to find out they’re showing signs of sleep apnea.  

Even so, Kuhlmann said users should approach Apple’s sleep apnea data with some caution, as readings could be erroneous. He said it is unlikely that insurance companies will begin paying for sleep apnea therapies like CPAP machines based on Apple Watch data alone, which is why it is important for patients to follow up with their healthcare providers to get an official diagnosis. 

“People do need to be diagnosed in order to be treated,” Kuhlmann told CNBC in an interview. 

Kuhlmann said the feature will likely cause an increase in visits to health care providers, which could ultimately reduce costs for U.S. the health-care system overall. Ideally, if patients catch sleep apnea earlier, they can avoid paying for treatments for more serious conditions down the line.

“By finding out that they have these underlying sleep disorders and getting them treated, it could potentially actually help save expenses and help improve quality of life.”

How it works 

Apple’s sleep apnea detection feature works by analyzing a new metric that the company calls “breathing disturbances.” The Apple Watch identifies breathing disturbances by using an accelerometer to measure movements at the wrist that indicate disruptions to normal breathing patterns. 

Users can view their nightly metrics in the Health app, where they’ll be classified as either “elevated” or “not elevated,” i.e., normal. Apple will analyze this breathing disturbance data once a month and notify people if they show “consistent signs” of severe or moderate sleep apnea. Users can view their data over a one-month, six-month or one-year period. 

The Apple Watch Series 10 supports an 18-hour battery life, so people who are interested in using this feature will likely need to charge their device during the day.

Apple can also generate a report that users can bring to their doctors to discuss next steps. The report includes three months’ worth of breathing disturbance data as well as some additional information, the company said. Users can access educational materials within the Health app as well. 

Apple said the notification algorithm was developed with “an extensive data set of clinical-grade sleep apnea tests,” and that the feature was validated in a clinical study.

“Now I’m jonesing to get an Apple [Watch] so I can try it out on myself,” Kuhlmann said.

Why are automaker stocks SO cheap?,"So I understand that the business of making cars isn’t a great one. Very capital intensive, low margins, tons of competition. But the valuations are ridiculously low, and I’m curious if someone has an explanation.

GM - 5.2x earnings

Volkswagen - 3.4x earnings

BMW - 4.54x earnings

Stellantis - 3.2x earnings

These are lower valuations than the forward multiple on Xerox, a company that’s obviously headed towards bankruptcy. A company that borrows money to pay its dividend. I can kinda understand the valuation for Stellantis as a lot of their brands are not doing well. But BMW and Volkswagen? Are they really doing this poorly? Keep in mind that VW owns Audi, Porsche, Lamborghini, etc.

15x earnings is a value stock in this market. 10x is deep value. 3x?

"It’s a big week for central banks around the world, with a slew of rate moves on the table","Nine months ago (i.e. December 2023), we were told that Fed was going to cut interest rates by 0.75% throughout 2024 while the market had once priced in more than 1.50% rate cut this year ...

As of today, no interest rate cut has been observed so far \~

How much will actually be reduced two days later?

*Key Points*

* *The Federal Reserve’s highly anticipated two-day meeting, which gets underway on Tuesday, is poised to take center stage.*
* *Elsewhere, Brazil’s central bank is scheduled to hold its next policy meeting on Wednesday. The Bank of England, Norway’s Norges Bank and South Africa’s Reserve Bank will all follow on Thursday.*
* *A busy week of central bank meetings will be rounded off when the Bank of Japan delivers its latest rate decision on Friday.*

*A flurry of major central banks will hold monetary policy meetings this week, with investors bracing for interest rate moves in either direction.*

*The Federal Reserve’s highly anticipated two-day meeting, which gets underway on Tuesday, is poised to take center stage.*

*The U.S. central bank is widely expected to join others around the world in starting its own rate-cutting cycle. The only remaining question appears to be by how much the Fed will reduce rates.*

*Traders currently see a quarter-point cut as the most likely outcome, although as many as 41% anticipate a half-point move, according to the CME’s FedWatch Tool.*

*Elsewhere, Brazil’s central bank is scheduled to hold its next policy meeting across Tuesday and Wednesday. The Bank of England, Norway’s Norges Bank and South Africa’s Reserve Bank will all follow on Thursday.*

*A busy week of central bank meetings will be rounded off when the Bank of Japan delivers its latest rate decision at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Friday.*

*“We’re entering a cutting phase,” John Bilton, global head of multi-asset strategy at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Thursday.*

*Speaking ahead of the European Central Bank’s most recent quarter-point rate cut, Bilton said the Fed was also set to cut interest rates by 25 basis points this week, with the Bank of England “likely getting in on the party” after the U.K. economy stagnated for a second consecutive month in July.*

*“We have all the ingredients for the beginning of a fairly extended cutting cycle but one that is probably not associated with a recession — and that’s an unusual set-up,” Bilton told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe.”*

*“It means that we get a lot of volatility to my mind in terms of price discovery around those who believe that actually the Fed \[is\] late, the ECB \[is\] late, this is a recession and those, like me, that believe that we don’t have the imbalances in the economy, and this will actually spur further upside.”*",182,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fi1vf6/its_a_big_week_for_central_banks_around_the_world/,nine month ago ie december told fed going cut interest rate throughout market priced rate cut year today interest rate cut observed far much actually reduced two day later xb big week central bank around world slew rate move table key point federal reserve highly anticipated twoday meeting get underway tuesday poised take center stage elsewhere brazil central bank scheduled hold next policy meeting wednesday bank england norway norge bank south africa reserve bank follow thursday busy week central bank meeting rounded bank japan delivers latest rate decision friday xb flurry major central bank hold monetary policy meeting week investor bracing interest rate move either direction federal reserve highly anticipated twoday meeting get underway tuesday poised take center stage u central bank widely expected join others around world starting ratecutting cycle remaining question appears much fed reduce rate trader currently see quarterpoint cut likely outcome although many anticipate halfpoint move according cmes fedwatch tool elsewhere brazil central bank scheduled hold next policy meeting across tuesday wednesday bank england norway norge bank south africa reserve bank follow thursday busy week central bank meeting rounded bank japan delivers latest rate decision conclusion twoday meeting friday entering cutting phase john bilton global head multiasset strategy jp morgan asset management told cnbcs squawk box europe thursday speaking ahead european central bank recent quarterpoint rate cut bilton said fed also set cut interest rate basis point week bank england likely getting party uk economy stagnated second consecutive month july ingredient beginning fairly extended cutting cycle one probably associated recession thats unusual setup bilton told cnbcs squawk box europe mean get lot volatility mind term price discovery around believe actually fed late ecb late recession like believe dont imbalance economy actually spur upside,it a big week for central bank around the world with a slew of rate move on the table,it a big week for central bank around the world with a slew of rate move on the table nine month ago ie december told fed going cut interest rate throughout market priced rate cut year today interest rate cut observed far much actually reduced two day later xb big week central bank around world slew rate move table key point federal reserve highly anticipated twoday meeting get underway tuesday poised take center stage elsewhere brazil central bank scheduled hold next policy meeting wednesday bank england norway norge bank south africa reserve bank follow thursday busy week central bank meeting rounded bank japan delivers latest rate decision friday xb flurry major central bank hold monetary policy meeting week investor bracing interest rate move either direction federal reserve highly anticipated twoday meeting get underway tuesday poised take center stage u central bank widely expected join others around world starting ratecutting cycle remaining question appears much fed reduce rate trader currently see quarterpoint cut likely outcome although many anticipate halfpoint move according cmes fedwatch tool elsewhere brazil central bank scheduled hold next policy meeting across tuesday wednesday bank england norway norge bank south africa reserve bank follow thursday busy week central bank meeting rounded bank japan delivers latest rate decision conclusion twoday meeting friday entering cutting phase john bilton global head multiasset strategy jp morgan asset management told cnbcs squawk box europe thursday speaking ahead european central bank recent quarterpoint rate cut bilton said fed also set cut interest rate basis point week bank england likely getting party uk economy stagnated second consecutive month july ingredient beginning fairly extended cutting cycle one probably associated recession thats unusual setup bilton told cnbcs squawk box europe mean get lot volatility mind term price discovery around believe actually fed late ecb late recession like believe dont imbalance economy actually spur upside,positive

I would say if they cut by 25 basis points expect the S&P and NASDAQ (because of tech) to go up 4% and 8% by the end of the week (respectively).

Office REITs- opportunity of the century?,"There's a saying, ""Be greedy when others are fearful, be fearful when others are greedy"", and it's very clear that the market is very fearful of offices right now, but very greedy with the broader market(especially AI). Many office REITs are trading for pennies on the dollar, at 1-2X their annual cash flows, meanwhile the S&P500 P/E ratio is about 30.

While the pandemic did temporarily reduce office demand due to work from home, most organizations are forcing employees back to the office at least part time.

As a result of the work from home trend, construction of new offices has stalled, and some offices have been converted to other uses such as mixed use/residential. So supply of offices is stagnating, while demand is stabilizing. The only reason vacancy is growing is because tenants with 5-10 year leases are not renewing based on decreases in utilization that happened in 2020. But as the last of these leases signed pre-2020 expire, vacancies should stop increasing.

The crazy think is office rents don't even have to climb to make a ton of money on this. You can literally just buy a REIT with a 50% FFO yield, and it pays for itself in 2 years.

The main key is to find REITs that are trading at a low Price/FFO, and that have low amounts of debt. Then calculate how much their revenues would need to decline for the investment to fail.

The math is quite staggering, a lot of these REITs appear to be priced on the assumption that they will lose 70-80% of their tenants within the next 5 years, will be unable to find new ones, won't be able to sell the property, and that interest rates will remain elevated. I just don't see that being likely unless we have a great-depression level economic event, or another major shift in workplace culture where WFH becomes the standard again.",28,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fi7pp7/office_reits_opportunity_of_the_century/,there saying greedy others fearful fearful others greedy clear market fearful office right greedy broader marketespecially ai many office reit trading penny dollar x annual cash flow meanwhile sp pe ratio pandemic temporarily reduce office demand due work home organization forcing employee back office least part time result work home trend construction new office stalled office converted u mixed useresidential supply office stagnating demand stabilizing reason vacancy growing tenant year lease renewing based decrease utilization happened last lease signed pre expire vacancy stop increasing crazy think office rent dont even climb make ton money literally buy reit ffo yield pay year main key find reit trading low priceffo low amount debt calculate much revenue would need decline investment fail math quite staggering lot reit appear priced assumption lose tenant within next year unable find new one wont able sell property interest rate remain elevated dont see likely unless greatdepression level economic event another major shift workplace culture wfh becomes standard,office reit opportunity of the century,office reit opportunity of the century there saying greedy others fearful fearful others greedy clear market fearful office right greedy broader marketespecially ai many office reit trading penny dollar x annual cash flow meanwhile sp pe ratio pandemic temporarily reduce office demand due work home organization forcing employee back office least part time result work home trend construction new office stalled office converted u mixed useresidential supply office stagnating demand stabilizing reason vacancy growing tenant year lease renewing based decrease utilization happened last lease signed pre expire vacancy stop increasing crazy think office rent dont even climb make ton money literally buy reit ffo yield pay year main key find reit trading low priceffo low amount debt calculate much revenue would need decline investment fail math quite staggering lot reit appear priced assumption lose tenant within next year unable find new one wont able sell property interest rate remain elevated dont see likely unless greatdepression level economic event another major shift workplace culture wfh becomes standard,negative
Can you be profitable solely by technical analysis?,"Im pretty new to stock trading, in fact, I just did my first deposit and I plan to slowly trade with it and make it grow, I have quite a lot of experience in Forex swing trading and I planned to do the same in stocks, I heard a lot of people just DCA when position goes against them and Im not sure if this is even a good idea (But to be fair it was one of my initial plans)
My initial idea was to find undervalued stocks (Ha, I don’t even know how to search for them) Purchase them when criteria aligns and DCA when criteria happens again if it kept going against me (which could mean waiting weeks or months for another entry) and add to positions in profit without adding any risk by protecting the new positions (In the same way you DCA and exit at breakeven when position recovers but in the opposite way…) The whole idea is not to just let losers run and cut the winners but also let the winners run and even add positions to them, to even a bit the balance…

I have some questions…

Just by technical analysis can you make profit on long term positions? If no, what usually people look appart ok “trusting” or “hoping” this specific company will perform better in the future?

is there any good material looking for long term investment strategies? Is it just better to invest in an index and forget?

How usually people find good stocks or undervalued stocks? Basically opportunities to buy? Just by reading forums / news? Any good training about that?

Any feedback appreciated and thanks for reading.

Does it make sense to sell Put options if I want to create a position in a company?,"Let’s say I want to own 100 shares of X company trading at 100$ and I have to cash to purchase 100 shares at 100$.

Would it make sense to sell a naked put option with strike of 100$ expiring weekly.

Scenario I can think of:

1. Price goes above 100$ EOW
2. Price goes below 100$ EOW
3. Price stays 100$ EOW

Scenario 1.
Can have 2 situations 
1. Price goes above strike plus premium. 
2. Price goes above strike but less than premium 
In situation 1 I lose out on potential gains if I owned shares at 100$
In situation 2 I gain the premium plus strike minus current price of stock.
I will not own any shares EOW and I come out with profit!

Scenario 2.
2 situations
1. Price goes below strike minus premium 
2. Price goes below strike but not minus premium

In situation 1 I will get exercised and have cost basis of strike minus premium and fees right? And so I’ll be holding the shares like I want but from strike instead of market price. 
I come out at a loss here and shares EOW.

In situation 2 I will get exercised but my premium received will be greater than the loss I have per share from strike price. 
So I come out with a smaller profit than scenario 1 and shares EOW.

Scenario 3.
I make the premium and get exercised. Basically scenario 2 situation 2 right? Minus fees.

Am I missing anything important here?

I see 5 outcomes and only 1 outcome at a loss and 1 outcome with missed gains.

And since I already want to own shares I don’t really see being exercised as too bad unless the shares tanked so much in 1 week that changes my thesis on the company. 

Should one do this on a weekly basis and collect premium instead of buying the shares?",7,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fidv89/does_it_make_sense_to_sell_put_options_if_i_want/,let say want share x company trading cash purchase share would make sense sell naked put option strike expiring weekly scenario think price go eow price go eow price stay eow scenario situation price go strike plus premium price go strike le premium situation lose potential gain owned share situation gain premium plus strike minus current price stock share eow come profit scenario situation price go strike minus premium price go strike minus premium situation get exercised cost basis strike minus premium fee right ill holding share like want strike instead market price come loss share eow situation get exercised premium received greater loss per share strike price come smaller profit scenario share eow scenario make premium get exercised basically scenario situation right minus fee missing anything important see outcome outcome loss outcome missed gain since already want share dont really see exercised bad unless share tanked much week change thesis company one weekly basis collect premium instead buying share,doe it make sense to sell put option if i want to create a position in a company,doe it make sense to sell put option if i want to create a position in a company let say want share x company trading cash purchase share would make sense sell naked put option strike expiring weekly scenario think price go eow price go eow price stay eow scenario situation price go strike plus premium price go strike le premium situation lose potential gain owned share situation gain premium plus strike minus current price stock share eow come profit scenario situation price go strike minus premium price go strike minus premium situation get exercised cost basis strike minus premium fee right ill holding share like want strike instead market price come loss share eow situation get exercised premium received greater loss per share strike price come smaller profit scenario share eow scenario make premium get exercised basically scenario situation right minus fee missing anything important see outcome outcome loss outcome missed gain since already want share dont really see exercised bad unless share tanked much week change thesis company one weekly basis collect premium instead buying share,negative

# [Stock futures are little changed as investors await major Fed decision: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/15/stock-futures-are-little-changed-as-investors-await-major-fed-decision-live-updates.html)
*****
> Stock futures were little changed Monday morning as investors await the Federal Reserve’s highly anticipated policy meeting, during which central bankers are expected to cut rates for the first time since 2020.
*****
> S&P 500 futures slipped less than 0.4%, while futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 104 points, or 0.2%. Meanwhile, Nasdaq-100 futures pulled back 0.3%.
*****
> Apple shares fell more than 2% in early trading after analysts at firms, including Bank of America and JPMorgan, noted that shipping times could point to lighter demand for iPhone 16 Pro models than the prior year.
*****
> The S&P 500 is less than 1% away from its July record and could notch a new all-time high this week. After a rough start to a historically weak September, the three major U.S. indexes ended last week’s trading session in the green, with the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite just closing their best week of 2024.
*****
> The Fed is set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday and are widely anticipated to make their first interest rate cut since they began hiking rates in March 2022. A cut this week would be a pivotal move, as many investors hope the decision could lower borrowing costs for companies and improve overall earnings growth — boosting economic growth.
*****
> The overnight lending rate is currently at 5.25% to 5.5%. Traders are split on whether the central bank will cut rates by 25 or 50 basis points, per the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
*****
> Stocks typically post strong gains during cycles where initial rate cuts are able to sustain economic expansion, BMO Capital chief investment strategist Brian Belski said.
*****
> “So long as nothing breaks in the economy, U.S. stocks remain firmly within a bull market, but with significantly strong trailing one-year performance headed into this initial rate cut, future gains are likely to be more muted relative to historical norms, in our view,” he said in a Friday note ahead.

Apple the new healthtech giant?,"
This week they launched the Hearing Aid feature, which lets AirPods essentially double up as listening devices plus hearing aids; at a fraction of conventional aids. Assuming it works as Apple claims, this is a crazy opportunity for them to disrupt a legacy market that is so rooted in tradition that I didn't even know could be disrupted. A successful product would mean a durable revenue stream in an increasingly comprehensive wearables portfolio for years to come. Bonus points, it's Apple's first real consumer product innovation in years.

Yet, the stock closed nearly flat on Monday (its launch event day); and I would attribute most of the week's gain to broader cycles rather than anything directly related to the company's fundamentals. My guess would be that Apple/market had pinned its entire Glowtime event on AI integration with the iPhone, tbh it wasn't that spectacular and this might have overshadowed the hearing aids announcement.

Does anyone see what I am seeing, or am I missing something here?

"What's wrong with this 0dte strategy?
","Say you have a budget of $1000. You buy $100 SPY/QQQ calls every day. Most will go to 0 but if the move is towards the upside (and stocks/options tend to convex to the upside) you would see a huge gain.

The math comes to you needing a 10x move at least 1/10 times to break even.

What do you think?

**UPDATE**

I never said this was some genius strategy but a lot of these comments are truly dumb.

1. there is no theta. It's 0dte.
2. there is no assignment. you are buying the call
3. there is no tits up/ lose it all scenario...since you only lose that one small bet at any given time.
4. strike price blah blah doesnt matter since you are betting on direction - however i guess it ideally has to be close to in the money for it to actually have a chance to make a big jump

How you actually lose: by bleeding out. by winning less than your starting principal. so the calculus is if you can expect to make more than $1000 over 10 bets on avg or not.",154,127,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fhmf8c/whats_wrong_with_this_0dte_strategy/,say budget buy spyqqq call every day go move towards upside stocksoptions tend convex upside would see huge gain math come needing x move least time break even think update never said genius strategy lot comment truly dumb theta dte assignment buying call tit lose scenariosince lose one small bet given time strike price blah blah doesnt matter since betting direction however guess ideally close money actually chance make big jump actually lose bleeding winning le starting principal calculus expect make bet avg,whats wrong with this dte strategy,whats wrong with this dte strategy say budget buy spyqqq call every day go move towards upside stocksoptions tend convex upside would see huge gain math come needing x move least time break even think update never said genius strategy lot comment truly dumb theta dte assignment buying call tit lose scenariosince lose one small bet given time strike price blah blah doesnt matter since betting direction however guess ideally close money actually chance make big jump actually lose bleeding winning le starting principal calculus expect make bet avg,positive
401k Allocation Change Needed?,"Hello all, how are all of you doing? I have already posted in the Bogleheads sub but i would like to hear the suggestions from this sub as well in regards to my current 401k allocation. I will be providing important details pertaining to my 401K's asset allocation  for your convenience.

I am 33 years old. I have a Roth 401(k) through work getting the full company match with an 8% rate. FYI, rather than managing myself, I am enrolled in Professional Management which is **Alight Financial Advisors** and they make the investment choices for me. Hence, I am paying a small amount of fees. Anyways, the distribution looks like this:

|Asset Class|Current Mix|
|:-|:-|
|Balanced - HISP (My company's saving plan) Balanced|9%|
|Bond - HISP U.S. Fixed Income|7%|
|Large U.S. Equity - HISP U.S. Large Cap Equity Fund|35%|
|Mid U.S.Equity - HISP U.S. Small-Mid Cap Equity Fund|19%|
|International - HISP Developed International Equity Fund|22%|
|Emerging Markets **-** HISP Emerging Markets Equity|8%|
|Stock - HISP Huntington Ingalls Stock|0% Alight didn't put any funds into the stock|

I am also providing the fund performance for each investment type:

|Asset Class|Average Annual Return|
|:-|:-|
|Balanced|1Y 17.68%; 3Y 3.34%; 5Y 8.42%|
|Bond|1Y 7.24%; 3Y -2.16%;  5Y -9.00%|
|Large U.S. Equity|1Y 27.05%; 3Y 9.32%; 5Y 15.84%|
|Mid U.S. Equity|1Y 20.84%; 3Y 0.18%; 5Y 11.11%|
|International|1Y 19.81%; 3Y 4.49%; 5Y 8.88%|
|Emerging Markets|1Y 13.87%; 3Y -3.50%; 5Y 4.42%|
|Stock|1Y 30.65%; 3Y 13.56%; 5Y 8.38%|

Expense ratios for all the funds are below:

|Asset Class|Expense Ratios|
|:-|:-|
|Balanced|0.11%|
|Bond|0.08%|
|Large U.S. Equity|0.07%|
|Mid U.S. Equity|0.08%|
|International|0.10%|
|Emerging Markets|0.14%|
|Stock|0.10%|

Portfolio Details:

# 2024 Return - 12.28%

As of Sep 13, 2024

||

|Opening Balance|$29,491.21|
|Gain|+ $4,300.24|
|Other Activity|+ $9,391.32|
|Closing Balance|$43,182.77|

Now that I provided all the details, my burning questions are following:

* **Should I make any changes to the allocation or it looks fine? Maybe put 100% funds into the Large U.S. Equity? Or Better diversify across all types of funds?**
* **Going over many reddit posts and youtube videos, it is recommend to have almost 100% invested into the equity and 5% to the bond or maybe not all to the bond. And what is your opinion about not putting money at all into the International equity fund? Feeling like I am answering my own questions haha.**
* **Last but not least, should I keep Alight managing this allocation or start managing it myself to avoid the fees?**

Advanced apologies for asking any stupid questions lol as I am new in this territory. Please let me know if you need any clarifications. I'll do my best to respond to it.

Nordstrom JWN,"We’re closing in on two weeks since it was unveiled that the Nordstrom family and the Mexican department store chain Liverpool made a bid for JWN at $23/share. 
When the bid was unveiled the price of the stock was the same as the bidding price, $23. However, it’s been close to half a year since it was announced that a special committee would be made to consider a buyout offer from the family and at that time the price of the stock was $17. So, $23 actually means a 35 % premium compared to March 2024 when it was announced a buyout offer would come - but now that we have the offer six months later, it may be to the family’s own misfortune that the price has gained 35 % making the offer perhaps seem like lowballing. But, did the price actually only go up because investors knew a buyout offer was underway? No one knows but Nordstrom has outperformed peers in recent quarters and delivered on earnings when peers haven’t. Furthermore, during these six months inflation has gone down and a rate cut is imminent indicating smoother sailing for retail. 

Today, two weeks after the bid was unveiled, the price seems anchored around $23. The Board needs to approve the bid for any sale to be completed. Macy’s and Kohl’s have also received bids in recent times but in both cases there have been significant premiums ranging from 30-40 %. Both companies declined despite these premiums. Nordstrom is a little different seeing as the family owns a big part of the company. However, the Board is perfectly capable of declining offers from the family as became clear just 8 years ago when the board declined an offer from the family for $50/share. 

Opinions and ideas on what’s going to happen to JWN in the days, weeks, months and years to come? Will the Board accept $23? If not, what will that do to the price of the stock? Will it crash or be unaffected?

Are there any companies that aren't noticeably tainted by some sort of negative reputation?,"While it's probably true that no company is completely ""clean,"" since the world of business often demands that they take any viable steps to preserve their bottom lines, are there any companies that exist that haven't accumulated any significant negative reputations in the court of public opinion?

It seems like they're hard to find, if they even exist at all. No matter what sector, there's some form of criticism that goes against them...

* Communication Services: Oligopolies (internet service companies), data privacy issues (GOOG, META)
* Consumer Discretionary: Anti-union practices and exploitation (AMZN, NKE)
* Consumer Staples: Anti-union practices and exploitation (WMT, TGT), environmental and health concerns (KO, MO)

Why Is the S&P 500 so Bullish?,"Hey everyone,

I've been closely following the current economic indicators and I'm puzzled by the S&P 500 reaching new all-time highs. I broke up my logic into individual points:

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Inflation Forecasts indicate that inflation remains stubbornly high. High inflation typically reduces consumer purchasing power and can squeeze corporate profit margins, which university theory says that these should pressure stock prices downward. Is this no longer the case?




The Federal Reserve has as we all know raised interest rates to combat inflation the past year or so. Higher interest rates increase borrowing costs for both consumers and businesses, which slow economic growth and make equities less attractive compared to fixed-income investments. Now this often isn't reflected in financial statements right away, it takes time for the effects of interest rates to effect the bottomline. You don't really notice until you start paying the cumulative interest.




Wall Street has been saying there's a 50% chance of a 0.5 rate cut pricing it into the market if the Fed decides to pause or reverse its tightening measures. If the Fed doesn’t act as expected, this uncertainty could lead to a tremendous oopsie daisy that no one seems to be talking about. When has the Fed acted in the interest of the equities market? They work for the government.




Youth unemployment rates ain't looking so good and there's a rising sense of generational hopelessness present in pop culture and everyday narratives.High youth unemployment can lead to reduced consumer spending which is pretty surface level, but on a large scale, doesn't this also lead to a reduced savings rate, less investments and therefore less money flowing into companies who need to maintain a large price



Now obviously these are a few off the top of my head examples pointing to the negative so I'm asking you to offer a counter-argument.


Why do YOU believe the S&P 500 is continuing to climb to new heights?

Are strong corporate earnings or future growth expectations counterbalancing these negative factors?

Are there international developments or global market trends supporting the S&P 500's rise?

Is the anticipation of future rate cuts fueling buying behavior now?

"With the fed cutting rates soon, when is the right time to re-enter the market?","Hi.

I have a few hundred grand in dry powder that I pulled out before stocks dropped badly, but they have recovered a bit. With the fed cutting rates soon, when is the most suitable time to put it back into the S&P / Nasdaq ?

Thanks.

"Verizon puts price tag on buyouts and says nearly 5,000 employees are leaving","Verizon Communications Inc. said Thursday it expects charges of up to $1.9 billion in its third quarter in connection with employee buyouts.

About 4,800 employees will leave the telecommunications giant by March under the voluntary separation program that Verizon announced in June. Half of those employees are leaving in September, the company said.

Verizon said that it expects to record severance charges in a range between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion, or $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion in after-tax charges, in the third quarter.

In a filing in February, Verizon said it had about 105,400 full-time employees as of December, with 89% of them based in the U.S.

Verizon also said that as part of ongoing cost-savings initiatives, it plans to stop using certain offices and leave “non-strategic portions” of certain businesses, without giving more details.

As a result, it also expects to record asset and business rationalization charges in the range of $230 million to $380 million, or $170 million to $290 million after tax, in the quarter.

Analysts polled by FactSet expect Verizon to report in mid-October adjusted earnings of $1.18 a share on sales of $33.7 billion for its third quarter.

In the third quarter of 2023, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 on sales of $33.3 billion.

Verizon earlier this month announced plans to buy Frontier Communications Parent Inc. in a $20 billion all-cash deal, a play for a fiber-internet provider in the U.S.

Verizon shares have gained more than 15% this year, slightly underperforming an advance of around 16% for the S&P 500

Public knowledge - Intel poised for sharp upmove this week,"A slew of positive news came in this weekend for Intel. That, combined with potential rate cuts, can only mean one direction for the stock.

Intel[ news - Search](https://news.google.com/search?for=intel&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en)

* $2B aid money for a new chip plant in Poland
* $3.5B military contract
* NVDA and Apple kindly 'nudged' to use Intel foundaries (instead of TSMC). This will be fun!

A lot of it seems like a government bailout, because chips are soooo strategic, critical, etc. That's what you get when people who think ""*files are in the cloud, up above*"" in literal sense, have too much legislative powers. But that's good news for a dinosaur company at least in the short term.

Besides, the company is exploring strategic options like selling parts of its business and scrapping some projects. The stock's price has already declined significantly since Intel reported its latest earnings in August, and it's one of the worst-performing S&P 500 stocks of the year. Yet, it's holding onto its place in the blue-chip Dow Jones index. The company is also exploring potential partnerships and acquisitions to strengthen its business.

Saudi Arabia expects to get access to Nvidia's high performance chips 'within the next year',"Saudi Arabia is optimistic about gaining access to U.S. chipmaker Nvidia's high-performance chips, which would enable it to develop and operate the most advanced artificial intelligence models.

Speaking to CNBC on Thursday, a top official at the Saudi Data and AI Authority, Abdulrahman Tariq Habib, said the kingdom expected to make such a stride in the next year.


""I think within the next year,"" Habib, Deputy CEO of SDAIA's strategy management office, told CNBC's Dan Murphy after being asked about a potential timeline. It's a significant expectation given that the United States' strict export controls have thus far prevented the chips' export to the kingdom. Habib made the comments on the sidelines of GAIN, Saudi Arabia's international AI summit, which took place in Riyadh this week.

It ""will mean a lot"" for Saudi Arabia to have access to the chips, Habib said — in this case, the Nvidia H200s, the firm's most powerful chips, which are used in OpenAI's GPT-4o.

""It will ease business between Saudi and U.S.,"" he said. ""It will also open a lot of doors for building the capability, the computational capabilities, in the kingdom. But most importantly, it's not only the computational capability that's important. We worked hard in the past three years in building capacity, in human capacity, we also build data capacity as well. So we are working and collaborating with all [of the] international community and contributing [to] be one of the top active countries in data analysis.""


Saudi Arabia is pouring considerable investment into developing a robust AI ecosystem in the kingdom, disclosing in a report by SDAIA that it aims to have AI make up 12% of its gross domestic product by 2030. According to the report, published on Sept. 9, the kingdom's $925 billion Public Investment Fund will lead the investment.

Uber and Waymo to offer driverless ride-sharing trips in Austin and Atlanta ,"Uber announced Friday it is expanding its partnership with Alphabet’s Waymo to offer robotaxi rides in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta beginning in early 2025. Shares of Uber jumped 5% on the news while Alphabet rose about 1%.

Uber riders in those cities can be matched with a driverless Waymo car for some trips, according to the companies. The rides will only be available through Uber’s app, unlike in San Francisco and Los Angeles where riders book through the Waymo app. A Waymo spokesperson said it had no plans to partner with Uber in San Francisco and Los Angeles.

The expansion comes as Uber faces investor pressure to step up its autonomous vehicle strategy, especially ahead of Tesla’s planned robotaxi event slated for Oct. 10. Shares of Uber have fallen 9% since the Tesla event was announced and are off 17% from their 52-week highs. 

It may also slow Waymo encroachment into Uber’s market share. An analysis from Bernstein estimated that, as of May 2024, Waymo’s 50,000 weekly paid rides made up approximately 2% of ride-sharing usage in San Francisco. Since then, Waymo has doubled its paid robotaxi trips to 100,000 a week, the company announced. 

“We’re thrilled to build on our successful partnership with Waymo, which has already powered fully autonomous trips for tens of thousands of riders in Phoenix,” Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a release. 

Uber’s initial agreement with Waymo in Phoenix also included autonomous Uber Eats deliveries in the city. The expansion into Austin and Atlanta won’t include Uber Eats at first, according to the Waymo spokesperson, but they’re exploring that possibility for the future. 

Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said, “We’ve been delighted at the positive feedback from our Waymo One riders to date, and we can’t wait to bring the comfort, convenience, and safety of the Waymo Driver to these cities in partnership with Uber.” 

The expansion into two more cities is another step in Uber’s advancement into the robotaxi space, after struggling to get a foothold and selling off its own self-driving division in 2020, now relying on partnerships with companies including Waymo, GM’s Cruise and the SoftBank-backed U.K. startup Wayve to gain ground. 

Uber shares dipped in August after the company announced a multiyear partnership with Cruise to offer autonomous rides through its app next year. Wells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski cited Cruise’s previous safety challenges as a part of the investor skepticism, along with now-fulfilled hopes for a partnership with Waymo instead. 

Waymo has rapidly made strides in the self-driving race. It currently offers robotaxi services to the public in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix. It has logged more than 22 million miles through June of this year, and last week, it released a report that argued its vehicles are safer than human drivers. It began testing driverless cars on Bay Area freeways with Google employees in August.

Some analysts were more hopeful for a potential Uber and Waymo expansion into San Francisco. But Atlanta and Austin, where Waymo has already begun testing, may still help sentiment.

$DJT (Not political) Just thoughts and an expectation of a super interesting stock ,"[https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-is-not-selling-his-shares-truth-social-company-2024-09-13/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-is-not-selling-his-shares-truth-social-company-2024-09-13/)

* **The major holder of $DJT said:  I will not sell. This being Trump, those that own the stock should think about the scenarios** 
   1. Trump will SELL (all or a very large portion) a week or so before the election, as he knows his company has little to zero value, especially if he loses.
   2. Trump is a man of his word, he will not sell 

* **Trump wins**
   * This stock will see 40$ - 80$ overnight. If he has sold, nobody will care. 
* **Trump loses**
   * His fans will lose fortunes.  There will be no consequence for Trump as this is his last political hurrah. 



* **Thoughts to consider**
   1. Would Trump pass on 1 billion (or more) if he knows that a negative election result will send the stock below 10$, or more likely below 5$ ? 
   2. Would Trump take the risk in a 50/50 win chance scenario of losing billions?  Or would he do as traders do?  Secure profits. 
   3. Trump is a businessman, he  does not do Charity (if anything his family/org is convicted of stealing from Cancer Kids Charity).  So, will he care about his fans/supporters?  

My theory is that the stock will rise into election day, if the polls are indicating a tight race or a lead.  A good entry point would be, I guess 15$.  Trade up to 25$ (or so) and take the investment out. Let the rest run, and sell at 46 (as a hommage to Biden).

Google is down almost 20 percent from ATH and has entered bear market territory. my thesis,"Google as the title states has gone down 20 percent from the ATH which is more than other big tech companies have seen. and is now in bear market territory. 

First let's start with the balance sheet of Google which is pretty good for the most part.  Google revenue has increased at a rate of 18.16 percent a year which is extremely fast top-line growth.  Free cash flow growth has been good but more and more is going towards capx while google tries to improve their LLM.  The free cash flow is also further hurt by their stock-based comp which last year counted for nearly 32 percent of all free cash flow. EPS is going up at a rate of 21 percent in the last 5 years which is being accelerated by google buying back shares.  They have minimal debt and lots of cash. they  have recently issued a dividend which is great because it returns more profits back to shareholders.

***Why is google trading down so much***

Google has recently found itself to be a convicted monopoly by the DOJ and is also seeing regulation from the EU as well in other anti monopoly lawsuits.  This has increased the level of uncertainty in the stock because the punishments have yet to be given leaving investors in limbo of how detrimental this could actually be.

Google as well as other big tech companies have been spending ungodly amounts of money chasing AI and while I do think AI could prove to be a worthwhile investment in the future in the short term this is causing companies like Google to not be as capital efficient as they once were.

***What will cause google stock to go up***

The thesis is simple...  Once time passes and we get past these anti-trust lawsuits the future from Google will seem more clear and this will help with investor sentiment and certainty and help contribute to an increase in stock price.  Google is currently spending money on a upgrade cycle which is AI.  Once the boom for AI starts to go down, capex spending should move down, allowing Google to return to a more capital efficient business model.  Also keep in mind that Google owns so many entities (YouTube, Google Cloud, Google Search, -google office suite, and android).

TLDR: Google stock is probably undervalued and its probably gonna go up lmao

Mathematically speaking is there a way to find an infinite money glitch if you have access to purchase both an asset and the short of that a,"Say you have an asset like stock ""A"" and that stock ""A"" is currently $10 a share. Within a brokerage you can buy many of stock ""A"". There is also a short of stock ""A"" that goes up 2X as fast as stock ""A"" goes down. When stock ""A"" has a bad day you would want to hold this short. For simplicity we will call the short of stock ""A"" as ABC stock.

My friend and I are both math nerds but would like to know if there is truly an infinite money glitch if you have access to both the stock and short of the stock? Does the short of the stock being 2X affect anything more or less than if the short was only going up exactly in line (1X) of the price of the stock?

More specifically as some of you are probably aware you can put in limit orders to buy a stock only if the stock price drops to being at or below a certain price. You also could buy using a trailing stop loss, so if and only iff the stock price drops 3% from the current or future price it will trigger a buy order.

Came across a formula that obviously was not totally accurate but maybe with some changes it could be either at or near a money glitch to always make money, granted you would need to go in every few days and put in the orders once the buy and/or sale happens. Mind you this assumes a person has +$25k in their account to do unlimited day trades.",0,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fh1po8/mathematically_speaking_is_there_a_way_to_find_an/,say asset like stock stock currently share within brokerage buy many stock also short stock go x fast stock go stock bad day would want hold short simplicity call short stock abc stock friend math nerd would like know truly infinite money glitch access stock short stock short stock x affect anything le short going exactly line x price stock specifically probably aware put limit order buy stock stock price drop certain price also could buy using trailing stop loss iff stock price drop current future price trigger buy order came across formula obviously totally accurate maybe change could either near money glitch always make money granted would need go every day put order buy andor sale happens mind assumes person k account unlimited day trade,mathematically speaking is there a way to find an infinite money glitch if you have access to purchase both an asset and the short of that a,mathematically speaking is there a way to find an infinite money glitch if you have access to purchase both an asset and the short of that a say asset like stock stock currently share within brokerage buy many stock also short stock go x fast stock go stock bad day would want hold short simplicity call short stock abc stock friend math nerd would like know truly infinite money glitch access stock short stock short stock x affect anything le short going exactly line x price stock specifically probably aware put limit order buy stock stock price drop certain price also could buy using trailing stop loss iff stock price drop current future price trigger buy order came across formula obviously totally accurate maybe change could either near money glitch always make money granted would need go every day put order buy andor sale happens mind assumes person k account unlimited day trade,positive
(9/13) Friday's Pre-Market News & Stock Movers,"#Good Friday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the final trading day of the week. Here are your pre-market movers & news on this Friday, September the 13th, 2024-

#[Stock futures rise after S&P 500 notches fourth-straight winning session: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/12/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures rose Friday as traders sought to shake off a sluggish September.
*****
> S&P 500 futures climbed about 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures hovered above flat. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 45 points, or 0.1%.
*****
> The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are coming off their fourth straight winning session, adding to their strong week-to-date performances. The broad market index is up nearly 3.5% this week, while the Nasdaq has popped 5.3%. The Dow has advanced 1.9%.
*****
> Wall Street is now looking ahead toward the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting on Sept. 17-18, where the central bank is largely anticipated to lower interest rates by 25 basis points. Currently, the Fed’s target rate is sitting at 5.25% to 5.5%.
*****
> Economic data reflecting a moderation in inflation also seemed to support the case for a rate cut. The consumer price index in August came in at 2.5% on annualized basis, the lowest level since February 2021. Wholesale prices, meanwhile, rose 0.2% in August, coming in line with expectations.
*****
> “At the end of the day, the U.S. consumer and the economy continue to do well, [and] profits continue to print above expectations,” Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at Solus Alternative Asset Management, said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Thursday. “And so while we had a meaningful sell-off driven by some of those AI names, for sure, the rebound seems entirely justified because it doesn’t seem like these issues are broadening out,” he added.
*****
> On the economic front, traders will look toward August’s import prices data Friday morning. Preliminary consumer sentiment figures for September are also scheduled for release.

Altimmune or Viking? The Obesity hype. $VKTX vs $ALT,"The Obesity Hype. A real hype that can blow portfolios more so than AI, look at the Viking stock trajectory. To figure out the science, is hard.

I am not saying buy this stock. I am saying, verify the below comparison with somebody. If the below is correct. You did your DD.

1. **Why $ALT over $VKTX?**
   * VKTX-2735 < PEMVI 2.4mg -- PEMVI superior quality of Weight Loss as measured by % FAT vs. % LEAN reduction (i.e. the KEY next-gen GLP1 metric)
   * PEMVI broad CARDIOVASCULAR activity/potential
   * PEMVI MOA includes Thermogenic/RMR component for LT use
   * PEMVI body recomp. potential via class-leading lean muscle preservation
   * PEMVI P3 titration/DR design to 'fix' outlier 48wk P2 (other PEMVI studies have shown tolerability on par with VK2735)
   * VK2735 is faster WL which is better for BMI 40+ class 3 Obesity (smaller market), but not for avg. person -- VK to compete with $LLY Zep,
   * PEMVI is SIGNIFICANTLY differentiated high quality Next-gen GLP1 WL
   * VKTX-2809 < PEMVI 1.8mg -- PEMVI rapid liver defatting in 6-12 wks (MASLD)
   * PEMVI better 24wk anti-fibrotic potential vs 52wk VKTX
   * PEMVI bypasses thyroid and is leading GLP1 liver MOA
2. **Why is Viking valued at 50$ and Altimmune at 6$?**
   * Viking Management simply is better at managing their stock. Viking has 900 million in cash, which they simply raised in a brilliant way.
   * Altimmune had some set-backs in the past, which may make WS suspicious.
   * Altimmune had a short report to endure, in which Kerrisdale stupidly rehashed old data, BUT Altimmune management FAILED at protecting the stock they let Jefferies do their bidding, plus their cash runway is not convincing. Their only response was a meaningless Tweet.
   * Altimmune cash runway 150 million (or so), they stupidly ran the ATM at the absolute wrong moment.
   * Altimmune is stupidly promising a partner for over a year now, and have not delivered.
3. **But why is Altimmune still the better stock?**
   * Pemvi as explained above, is smarter. Not Obesity, but curative fatty liver - COVERED BY INSURANCE ALREADY. Which pure obesity drugs are not, like Zepbound Wegovy
   * Altimmune has FAST TRACK status. A nugget overseen by many

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Adobe stock slips on soft fourth-quarter revenue guidance,"Adobe reported third-quarter results on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations for sales and earnings, but the stock slid 10% in extended trading on fourth-quarter guidance that came up short.

Here’s how Adobe did for the quarter ending in August versus LSEG consensus estimates:

Revenue: $5.41 billion, vs. $5.37 billion expected

Earnings per share: $4.65, adjusted, vs. $4.53 estimated

Adobe said it expected earnings per share between $4.63 and $4.68 on revenue in the fourth quarter of between $5.5 billion and $5.55 billion. Analysts polled by LSEG were expecting a forecast of $4.67 of earnings on $5.61 billion of sales.

Adobe said it recorded $1.68 billion of net income during the quarter, or $3.76 per diluted share. That’s up from $1.40 billion, or $3.05 per share in the year-ago period.

Adobe’s biggest line of business, Digital Media, which includes the company’s Creative Cloud subscriptions that use generative AI called Firefly, grew 11% on an annual basis to sales of $4 billion.

In total, Adobe recorded $5.18 billion in subscription revenue during the quarter, up 11% year-over-year.

"Ajit Jain, Buffett's insurance chief, dumps more than half his Berkshire stake ","Ajit Jain, Warren’s Buffett’s insurance chief and top executive, sold more than half of his stake in Berkshire Hathaway, a new regulatory filing showed.

The 73-year-old vice chairman of insurance operations dumped 200 shares of Berkshire Class A shares on Monday at an average price of $695,418 per share for roughly $139 million. That left him holding just 61 shares, while family trusts established by himself and his spouse for the benefit of his descendants hold 55 shares and his nonprofit corporation, the Jain Foundation, owns 50 shares. Monday’s sale represented 55% of his total stake in Berkshire.

The move marked the biggest decline in Jain’s holdings since he joined Berkshire in 1986. It’s unclear what motivated Jain’s sales, but he did take advantage of Berkshire’s recent high price. The conglomerate traded above $700,000 to hit a $1 trillion market capitalization at the end of August.

“This appears to be a signal that Ajit views Berkshire as being fully valued,” said David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business. 

It’s also consistent with a significant slowdown in Berkshire’s share buyback activity as of late. Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire repurchased just $345 million worth of its own stock in the second quarter, significantly lower than the $2 billion repurchased in each of the prior two quarters.

“I think at best it is a sign that the stock is not cheap,” said Bill Stone, CIO at Glenview Trust Co. and a Berkshire shareholder. “At over 1.6 times book value, it is probably around Buffett’s conservative estimate of intrinsic value. I don’t expect many, if any, stock repurchases from Berkshire around these levels.”

The India-born Jain has played a crucial role in Berkshire’s unmatched success. He facilitated a push into the reinsurance industry and more recently led a turnaround at Geico, Berkshire’s crown jewel auto insurance business. In 2018, Jain was named vice chairman of insurance operations and appointed to Berkshire’s board of directors.

“Ajit has created tens of billions of value for Berkshire shareholders,” Buffett wrote in his annual letter in 2017. “If there were ever to be another Ajit and you could swap me for him, don’t hesitate. Make the trade!”

Before it was officially announced that Greg Abel, Berkshire’s vice chairman of noninsurance operations, will eventually succeed the 94-year-old Buffett, there were rumors about Jain one day leading the conglomerate. Buffett recently clarified that Jain “never wanted to run Berkshire” and there wasn’t any competition between the two.

NVDA Bear Case | AI Bubble Collapse | Falsifying the Scalability Hypothesis | Thematics,"# Background

 The AI scaling hypothesis is a key concept in artificial intelligence research that suggests improvements in AI capabilities can be achieved primarily by increasing the size and computational resources of AI models. We can understand several aspects of this hypothesis:

Key Points of the AI Scaling Hypothesis

1. **Emergence of Capabilities**: As AI models grow larger and are trained on more data, they tend to develop new capabilities that were not explicitly programmed. This emergence of novel abilities is a central tenet of the scaling hypothesis.
2. **Generalization**: Larger models demonstrate improved ability to generalize across different tasks and domains, often showing surprising competence in areas they were not specifically trained for.
3. **Efficiency in Learning**: Scaled-up models can learn more efficiently from limited data, sometimes matching or surpassing the performance of smaller, task-specific models with just a few examples.
4. **Continuous Improvement**: The hypothesis suggests that continuing to scale up models will lead to further improvements in AI performance and capabilities, potentially approaching or even surpassing human-level abilities in various domains.

# Hyperscalers and First Mover Advantage

The scaling hypothesis has been a driving force behind many recent advancements in AI, including large language models and multimodal AI systems. However, it's important to note that while scaling has proven effective, it also comes with challenges such as increased computational requirements and potential biases in large datasets.

Hyperscalers are racing to scale their AI capabilities and be ***the first to discover emergent properties for several compelling reasons at any cost. This is the main driver in the billions of capital expenditures over the last 18 months.*** At the forefront is the significant competitive advantage that comes with pioneering new AI capabilities in the fast-evolving tech landscape. Being first allows these companies to establish market dominance, attract and retain customers seeking cutting-edge AI solutions, and gain valuable insights from early deployments. This advantage is not merely about prestige; it translates directly into substantial economic benefits.

The economic incentives driving this race are staggering. Industry projections suggest that AI technology in data centers alone could drive spending of up to $2 trillion over the next five years. Additionally, the AI silicon market is expected to reach $400 billion by 2027. These figures underscore the massive financial opportunity that awaits those who lead in AI capabilities. Hyperscalers are positioning themselves to capitalize on the growing demand for custom AI silicon and infrastructure, potentially securing a significant share of this burgeoning market.

The rush to scale is also fueled by the promise of technological breakthroughs. ***The AI scaling hypothesis suggests that continued increases in model size and computational resources will lead to the emergence of novel capabilities not explicitly programmed, improved generalization across different tasks and domains, and more efficient learning from limited data***\*.\* This potential for transformative advancements keeps hyperscalers intensely focused on pushing the boundaries of AI scale.

Hyperscalers are uniquely positioned in this race due to their existing infrastructure advantages. They possess the necessary computational resources, data centers, and cloud infrastructure that can be leveraged for AI training and deployment. This allows them to offer scalable AI services to a wide range of customers, from individuals to large enterprises, further cementing their market position.

Strategically, leading in AI capabilities allows hyperscalers to shape the future direction of AI development and applications, influence industry standards, and attract top AI talent and research partnerships. The potential for breakthrough discoveries, including the possibility of approaching or surpassing human-level abilities in various domains or even developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), adds another layer of motivation to their efforts.

# Falsifying the Scalability Hypothesis

The AI scaling hypothesis has been a driving force behind many recent advancements in artificial intelligence, but there are compelling arguments for how it could potentially be falsified

One primary method would be ***to demonstrate diminishing returns as models are scaled up in size and computational resources.*** ***If performance gains plateau or even decline rather than continuing to improve linearly or superlinearly, it would suggest fundamental limits to scaling***. This could be coupled with identifying qualitative gaps – cognitive abilities or tasks that larger models consistently fail at, even as they improve on other benchmarks. Such findings would indicate that some fundamental capabilities are missing and cannot be addressed by pure scaling alone.

# Simple Bench

Simple bench is the only reasoning benchmark written in natural language at which English-speaking humans (and yes, even 'smart highschoolers') can score 90%+, while frontier LLMs get less than 50%. It is an encapsulation of the reasoning deficit found in AI like ChatGPT.

 What the benchmark does is take a standard kind of logic puzzle that people ask LLM's, then spikes it with a ""surprise twist"" that requires what we would think of as common sense.  Thus an AI has more difficulty in predicting the next tokens because of the twist.  But humans can still reason out an answer.

These questions are fully private, preventing contamination, and have been vetted by PhDs from multiple domains, as well as the author - Philip, from AI Explained - who first exposed the numerous errors in the MMLU (Aug 2023). \[https://simple-bench.com/about.html\]

|GPT-4o|Not publicly disclosed|
|Claude|Not publicly disclosed|
|||

***These large AI companies don’t disclose training parameter sizes because we can graph training size vs benchmark score to falsify the scalability hypothesis.***

The AI scaling hypothesis has been a driving force behind significant advancements in artificial intelligence, propelling the development of increasingly powerful models and fueling a race among hyperscalers to achieve breakthrough capabilities. This hypothesis has led to remarkable improvements in AI performance across various domains, from natural language processing to computer vision and beyond.

However, as we delve deeper into the realm of large-scale AI models, we are beginning to encounter signs that suggest the scaling hypothesis may have limitations. The emergence of benchmarks like Simple Bench, which reveal persistent reasoning deficits in even the most advanced language models, indicates that simply increasing model size and computational resources may not be sufficient to achieve human-level reasoning capabilities.

The reluctance of major AI companies to disclose training parameter sizes for their latest models adds another layer of intrigue to this discussion. ***This lack of transparency makes it challenging for the broader scientific community to accurately assess the relationship between model scale and performance, potentially hindering efforts to validate or falsify the scaling hypothesis.***

Moreover, the increasing costs associated with training and deploying ever-larger models, coupled with concerns about data scarcity and computational limitations, raise questions about the long-term sustainability of the scaling approach. As we approach these practical and theoretical limits, it becomes clear that the future of AI advancement may require more than just scaling up existing architectures.

Looking ahead, the field of AI research may need to pivot towards more innovative approaches that focus on qualitative improvements in model architecture, training methodologies, and data utilization. The development of more sophisticated benchmarks, like Simple Bench, that can effectively measure complex reasoning abilities will be crucial in guiding these efforts.

Ultimately, while the scaling hypothesis has undoubtedly driven remarkable progress in AI, its limitations are becoming increasingly apparent. The next frontier in AI research may lie not in building ever-larger models, but in developing more efficient, adaptable, and truly intelligent systems that can match or exceed human-level reasoning across a wide range of tasks. This shift could lead to a new paradigm in AI development, one that combines the insights gained from scaling with novel approaches to create more capable and robust artificial intelligence.

# AI Bubble Collapse and Trillions in Misallocated Capital

 The AI scaling hypothesis has been the cornerstone of recent advancements in artificial intelligence, driving unprecedented investments and fueling a race among tech giants to build ever-larger models. However, as we stand on the precipice of a potential paradigm shift, the falsification of this hypothesis could trigger a seismic disruption in the AI industry, potentially leading to the collapse of what many now recognize as an AI bubble.

The signs of this impending crisis are becoming increasingly apparent. Benchmarks like Simple Bench are exposing critical reasoning deficits in even the most advanced language models, defying the expectation that larger models inherently lead to more intelligent systems. The reluctance of major AI companies to disclose training parameter sizes for their latest models further fuels suspicion that the relationship between scale and performance may not be as straightforward as once believed.

 As the evidence mounts against the scaling hypothesis, we must confront the sobering reality of the potential misallocation of trillions of dollars in capital. Hyperscalers and investors have poured vast resources into the development of massive data centers, custom AI chips, and enormous models, all predicated on the belief that bigger is inherently better. If this foundational assumption proves false, the repercussions will be far-reaching and profound.

The collapse of the AI bubble, triggered by the falsification of the scaling hypothesis, could lead to:

1.  A dramatic reassessment of the valuations of AI-focused companies, potentially wiping out billions in market capitalization.

2.  A crisis of confidence in the AI industry, leading to a sharp decline in investment and a potential ""AI winter.""

**This potential collapse serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of putting too much faith in a single hypothesis**, no matter how compelling it may seem. It underscores the critical importance of diverse approaches in AI research and the need for rigorous, independent verification of claims made by industry leaders.

Microsoft hires former GE CFO Carolina Dybeck Happe as new operating chief ,"Microsoft told employees on Thursday that it has hired Carolina Dybeck Happe as its executive vice president and chief operating officer, reporting to CEO Satya Nadella. Dybeck Happe comes from GE, where she was senior vice president and chief financial officer from 2020 until September 2023.

The appointment reflects Microsoft’s commitment to ensuring it remains coordinated as so much of the company has become oriented around artificial intelligence.

She will join Microsoft’s senior leadership team alongside finance chief Amy Hood, cloud and AI engineering leader Scott Guthrie and other executives.

“Carolina will partner with the SLT to help us drive continuous business process improvement across all our organizations and accelerate our company-wide AI transformation, increasing value to customers and partners,” Nadella wrote in a memo to employees.

Nadella said Dybeck Happe will take over Guthrie’s commerce and ecosystems organization, the Microsoft Digital IT team under Office software leader Rajesh Jha and the Microsoft Business Operations unit in the finance department.

Dybeck Happe’s appointment comes months after GE’s aviation and energy businesses, known as GE Aerospace and GE Vernova respectively, started trading on the New York Stock Exchange. GE announced plans to split into three companies in 2021.

GE CEO Larry Culp called Dybeck Happe “a high-impact executive” when GE announced in 2019 that it had picked Dybeck Happe to replace Jamie Miller as chief financial officer.

She joined GE from Maersk, where she had been finance chief. Before that, she spent almost 17 years at Swedish lock company Assa Abloy, where she became chief financial officer and deputy CEO.

Microsoft has not had an operating chief since 2016, when former Walmart executive Kevin Turner left.

McDonald’s to extend $5 value meal offer into December in most U.S. markets,"MCD rose by more than 15% since early July 2024 while US economy continues to cool off \~

Extending the value meal offer seems positive for MCD yet probably reflecting the issue arising from overall economy ...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**McDonald’s to extend $5 value meal offer into December in most U.S. markets**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/12/mcdonalds-to-extend-5-value-meal-offer-into-december.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/12/mcdonalds-to-extend-5-value-meal-offer-into-december.html)

*Key Points*

* *McDonald’s will extend its $5 value meal into December in most U.S. markets.*
* *Franchisees have been voting on extending the value meal in their local markets, and roughly 80% of local markets have opted to extend the deal into December.*
* *The restaurant sector focused on value this summer, as companies including McDonald’s, Burger King and even Starbucks attempted to lure consumers in with discounted offerings as diners cut back on restaurant spending.*

&#x200B;

*McDonald’s will extend its $5 value meal into December in most U.S. markets as it looks to win back lower-income consumers.*

*Franchisees have been voting on extending the value meal, and roughly 80% of local markets have opted to extend the deal into December. Votes on extensions are ongoing, so additional locations may be added in the weeks to come.*

*The value meal offers a McDouble or McChicken sandwich, small fries, four-piece chicken nuggets and a small soft drink for $5.*

*Owners will also be offering local promotions in the weeks and months to come, in addition to the value bundle, the company said. Deals will also be available in McDonald’s app.*

*“Together with our franchisees, we’re committed to keeping our prices as affordable as possible, which is why we’re doubling down with even more ways to save,” McDonald’s U.S. President Joe Erlinger said in a statement about the meal’s extension into December.*

*The restaurant sector focused on value this summer, as companies including McDonald’s, Burger King and even Starbucks attempted to lure consumers in with discounted offerings. Diners have pulled back on their restaurant spending after years of persistent inflation.*

*After McDonald’s posted declining second-quarter same-store sales in July, executives told restaurant operators and analysts the company would focus on how to recapture consumers with deals, as they pushed for an extension of the $5 value meal. The offer ran through the end of August, after 93% of restaurants had agreed to keep it on the menu following its initial four-week run in June and July.*

*In a memo to the U.S. system obtained by CNBC after the July earnings report, Erlinger said McDonald’s struggled to sell diners on affordability in the most recent quarter, adding that he expects “industry and competitive challenges” to continue throughout the year. Erlinger encouraged operators to look ahead to building momentum for next year, adding that “channeling a long-term mindset is crucial” to the company’s success.*

*“Reversing the narrative and re-establishing our position as the leader on value and affordability is possible, but it cannot be done overnight,” he wrote at the time. “It will happen through sustained and coordinated actions that show the customer we’re on their side.”*

*The $5 meal trial performed well among low-income consumers, and sentiment around the company’s value had started to improve, Erlinger said in the July memo.*",232,150,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ff05du/mcdonalds_to_extend_5_value_meal_offer_into/,mcd rose since early july u economy continues cool extending value meal offer seems positive mcd yet probably reflecting issue arising overall economy xb xb mcdonalds extend value meal offer december u market key point mcdonalds extend value meal december u market franchisees voting extending value meal local market roughly local market opted extend deal december restaurant sector focused value summer company including mcdonalds burger king even starbucks attempted lure consumer discounted offering diner cut back restaurant spending xb mcdonalds extend value meal december u market look win back lowerincome consumer franchisees voting extending value meal roughly local market opted extend deal december vote extension ongoing additional location may added week come value meal offer mcdouble mcchicken sandwich small fry fourpiece chicken nugget small soft drink owner also offering local promotion week month come addition value bundle company said deal also available mcdonalds app together franchisees committed keeping price affordable possible doubling even way save mcdonalds u president joe erlinger said statement meal extension december restaurant sector focused value summer company including mcdonalds burger king even starbucks attempted lure consumer discounted offering diner pulled back restaurant spending year persistent inflation mcdonalds posted declining secondquarter samestore sale july executive told restaurant operator analyst company would focus recapture consumer deal pushed extension value meal offer ran end august restaurant agreed keep menu following initial fourweek run june july memo u system obtained cnbc july earnings report erlinger said mcdonalds struggled sell diner affordability recent quarter adding expects industry competitive challenge continue throughout year erlinger encouraged operator look ahead building momentum next year adding channeling longterm mindset crucial company success reversing narrative reestablishing position leader value affordability possible cannot done overnight wrote time happen sustained coordinated action show customer side meal trial performed well among lowincome consumer sentiment around company value started improve erlinger said july memo,mcdonalds to extend value meal offer into december in most u market,mcdonalds to extend value meal offer into december in most u market mcd rose since early july u economy continues cool extending value meal offer seems positive mcd yet probably reflecting issue arising overall economy xb xb mcdonalds extend value meal offer december u market key point mcdonalds extend value meal december u market franchisees voting extending value meal local market roughly local market opted extend deal december restaurant sector focused value summer company including mcdonalds burger king even starbucks attempted lure consumer discounted offering diner cut back restaurant spending xb mcdonalds extend value meal december u market look win back lowerincome consumer franchisees voting extending value meal roughly local market opted extend deal december vote extension ongoing additional location may added week come value meal offer mcdouble mcchicken sandwich small fry fourpiece chicken nugget small soft drink owner also offering local promotion week month come addition value bundle company said deal also available mcdonalds app together franchisees committed keeping price affordable possible doubling even way save mcdonalds u president joe erlinger said statement meal extension december restaurant sector focused value summer company including mcdonalds burger king even starbucks attempted lure consumer discounted offering diner pulled back restaurant spending year persistent inflation mcdonalds posted declining secondquarter samestore sale july executive told restaurant operator analyst company would focus recapture consumer deal pushed extension value meal offer ran end august restaurant agreed keep menu following initial fourweek run june july memo u system obtained cnbc july earnings report erlinger said mcdonalds struggled sell diner affordability recent quarter adding expects industry competitive challenge continue throughout year erlinger encouraged operator look ahead building momentum next year adding channeling longterm mindset crucial company success reversing narrative reestablishing position leader value affordability possible cannot done overnight wrote time happen sustained coordinated action show customer side meal trial performed well among lowincome consumer sentiment around company value started improve erlinger said july memo,positive

- They also have a ratio of 8:1 in terms of total current assets to total current liabilities. Meaning they can payoff their short term debt 8x. This is good news. 
Id also like to add an investment piece they have “We have excluded the impact of the Shopify investment option of 15,743,174 shares at $88.93 per share as it was out of the money as of June 30, 2024. The investment option expires on July 28, 2030.”

They have a phat relationship with Shopify and are expecting to grow with them and capitalize on their company growth.

**Good News**

Expanded SMS offering to 12 countries with availability in Austria, Switzerland and Spain.Announced new integrations with Toast, BazaarVoice, TikTok, and Pinterest, adding to the company's more than 350 third-party integrations.New and expansion deals closed with Samsonite, Herschel Supply Company, and Barstool Sports and others during the quarter ended June 30, 2024.Over 151,000 customers were using Klaviyo to drive their own revenue growth as of June 30, 2024, compared to over 130,000 customers as of June 30, 2023.
Increased penetration up market, ending the quarter with 2,386 customers generating over $50,000 of ARR, compared to 1,458 at the end of the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 64% year-over-year. Also good to note this is the highest number of greater than 50,000 ARR customers that they have in their company's history.

According to Klaviyo's own data - more than 20,000 brands have switched from Mailchimp to Klaviyo (note Mailchimp was acquired by intuit back in 2021). 

Klaviyo virtually integrates with every eCommerce platform and app you'll ever need. It has over 200+ pre-built integrations to customer support tools, SMS tools, loyalty programs, user-generated content, subscription tools, payments, and virtually any app you have in your tech stack.

**Price Targets**

Needham: $40 (9/4/24)
Barclays: Overweight ($32) (8/8/24)
Keyblanc: ($33) (8/8/24)

**Financial Outlook**
Revenue: Q3 (225M) -> Q4 (910M)
Non-GAAP: Q3 (21.5M) -> Q4 (103M)


Their spending on R&D and G&A were both down by 100+ basis points on their recent earnings report. As they increased their spending on Sales and Marketing which they already stated would be happening in the previous quarters. 

TLDR: KVYO good deals, solid growth projections, great leadership/board, entry price slightly higher than IPO price, starting to dominate its industry and acquiring customers from Mailchimp. 

This is *just* DD I have no positions currently, but I *AM* looking to acquire shares, and most likely calls for the next earnings in November.

Trump Media Stock Takes 15% Hit Post-Debate Amid Investor Concerns Over 2024 Campaign,"Following the recent debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, the stock of Trump Media & Technology Group (parent company of Truth Social) experienced a significant decline of over 15%. Investors appeared unsettled by Trump's political performance, which has historically influenced the stock's value. Since Harris replaced Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee, Trump Media’s stock has plummeted by around 60%, reflecting growing uncertainty about Trump’s political future.



Investor sentiment is increasingly tied to Trump’s election prospects. His involvement in the 2024 presidential race has led to fluctuating market reactions, particularly as political debates shape public perception. Analysts believe the stock’s value could be impacted further depending on Trump’s ability to regain political traction, which is currently under scrutiny after the debate.



The drop also highlights broader market concerns about the viability of Truth Social in an evolving media landscape. Investors are questioning its long-term profitability, especially as political shifts create volatility in Trump-affiliated ventures.



The post-debate decline signals that Trump's business interests are deeply tied to his political career, and investor confidence is wavering based on his current standing in the race.

"If your the type of investor who mainly invests in companies that benefits your life, do you invest in RDDT?","For example my cousin is a big Apple person (Iphone, Apple Watch, Apple TV etc) and is a shopaholic at Ulta. So she purchases stocks of these companies.  She says she doesn't care about the stock performance that much - as these companies provide her with value and satisfaction in her life. 

In a way, like trying to recover the cost for the several Iphones she has bought since the start. 

But when I asked her about Reddit... something she uses, she is iffy about purchasing the stock.  Her reasoning is, its offerings is not tangible.. so she is not sure how the company really makes money.  Even with ads propping up, she isn't sold ... for now.

I personally have bought some RDDT stocks because I use it often and feel like I owe it back if that makes sense.

Ok question for those that have the mindset more like my cousin or in general don't see a pathway to solid profitability.

>Scenerio: If RDDT couldn't continue to operate due to lack of ads profit and mediocre stock performance. Would you buy some of its stocks... help raise capital and keep it above water?

I don't believe it will happen, but man it be a bummer if it ever went under.

I developed a Script to automatically send you notifications when news for a company you want to track release!,"Hey there a few days ago I wanted to track a companys press releases and realized that I couldn't sign up to a newsletter or anything like it. I wanted to be updated when a new press release came out so I wrote a script that did just that. The project got a bit out of hand and I ended up creating a Script that works universally with any given press release site and sends a notification to a webhook when something new comes up. By using a webhook app you can therefore get notifcation right to your phone. I uploaded the script to github I hope you like it and it helps some of you with your analysis/tracking:

Summarized comments from Jensen Huang from today's GS Conference,"1) Jensen once again highlights his view that Moore's Law no longer delivers the rate of innovation that's needed and causes computation inflation in Data Center. As such, the rebuilding of $1T data center infrastructure that's currently installed will drive growth over the next 10 years, bringing material performance improvement and cost savings

  
2) ROI: Jensen reiterates that while using a GPU to augment a CPU will drive an increase in cost in nominal terms (roughly 2x), in the case of Spark (a distributed processing system and analytics engine for big data), the net cost benefit could be as large as 10x as the application will be sped up 20x.

  
From a top line generation, he shares that hyperscale customers can generate $5 in rental revenue for every $1 spent on NVDA GPUs, given sustained strength in the demand for accelerated computing.

  
3) With respect to Nvidia's moat, Jensen highlights that the large install base of NVDA GPUs across multiple platforms, ability to augment their hardware with their proprietary software, and ability to build rack-level systems and innovate across various chips creates an insurmountable moat.

  
4) Jensen once again compliments his supply chain partners, highlighting TSMC for being the reason for NVDA's exponential revenue growth in 2H23/2024. That being said, he did note that NVDA has adequate in-house IP to shift manufacturing without material disruption if needed. He also stressed that companies are relentlessly demanding new chips so they can be first, to the point where tensions are rising as they demand their chips now.

  
5) The most important part: Jensen reiterated that the company will begin shipping Blackwell chips in 4Q25 and that shipments will scale in FY26 (Note that NVDA is currently in 3Q25 for their accounting calendar). Demand for Blackwell is incredibly strong and he feels that NVDA has a personal responsibility to ensure all companies are able to obtain the supplies needed to develop AI",192,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fenhlm/summarized_comments_from_jensen_huang_from_todays/,jensen highlight view moore law longer delivers rate innovation thats needed cause computation inflation data center rebuilding data center infrastructure thats currently installed drive growth next year bringing material performance improvement cost saving roi jensen reiterates using gpu augment cpu drive increase cost nominal term roughly x case spark distributed processing system analytics engine big data net cost benefit could large x application sped x top line generation share hyperscale customer generate rental revenue every spent nvda gpus given sustained strength demand accelerated computing respect nvidias moat jensen highlight large install base nvda gpus across multiple platform ability augment hardware proprietary software ability build racklevel system innovate across various chip creates insurmountable moat jensen compliment supply chain partner highlighting tsmc reason nvdas exponential revenue growth h said note nvda adequate inhouse ip shift manufacturing without material disruption needed also stressed company relentlessly demanding new chip first point tension rising demand chip important part jensen reiterated company begin shipping blackwell chip q shipment scale fy note nvda currently q accounting calendar demand blackwell incredibly strong feel nvda personal responsibility ensure company able obtain supply needed develop ai,summarized comment from jensen huang from today g conference,summarized comment from jensen huang from today g conference jensen highlight view moore law longer delivers rate innovation thats needed cause computation inflation data center rebuilding data center infrastructure thats currently installed drive growth next year bringing material performance improvement cost saving roi jensen reiterates using gpu augment cpu drive increase cost nominal term roughly x case spark distributed processing system analytics engine big data net cost benefit could large x application sped x top line generation share hyperscale customer generate rental revenue every spent nvda gpus given sustained strength demand accelerated computing respect nvidias moat jensen highlight large install base nvda gpus across multiple platform ability augment hardware proprietary software ability build racklevel system innovate across various chip creates insurmountable moat jensen compliment supply chain partner highlighting tsmc reason nvdas exponential revenue growth h said note nvda adequate inhouse ip shift manufacturing without material disruption needed also stressed company relentlessly demanding new chip first point tension rising demand chip important part jensen reiterated company begin shipping blackwell chip q shipment scale fy note nvda currently q accounting calendar demand blackwell incredibly strong feel nvda personal responsibility ensure company able obtain supply needed develop ai,positive
Berkshire unloads another chunk of Bank of America as CEO lauds Buffett ,"Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway offloaded another chunk of Bank of America shares, bringing its total sales to more than $7 billion since mid-July and reducing its stake to 11%.

The Omaha-based conglomerate shed a total of 5.8 million BofA shares in separate sales on Friday, Monday and Tuesday for almost $228.7 million at an average selling price of $39.45 per share, according to a new regulatory filing.

The latest action extended Berkshire’s selling streak to 12 consecutive sessions, matching the 12 consecutive sessions from July 17 to Aug. 1.

Berkshire has sold more than 174.7 million shares of the Charlotte-based bank for $7.2 billion, with 858.2 million shares remaining, or 11.1% of shares outstanding. BofA has fallen to the No.3 spot on Berkshire’s list of top holdings, trailing behind Apple and American Express. Before the selling spree, BofA had long been Berkshire’s second biggest holding.

Moynihan on Buffett

Buffett famously bought $5 billion worth of BofA’s preferred stock and warrants in 2011 in the aftermath of the financial crisis. He converted those warrants in 2017, making Berkshire the largest shareholder in BofA. The “Oracle of Omaha” then added 300 million more shares to his bet around 2018 and 2019.

BofA CEO Brian Moynihan made a rare comment about Berkshire’s sales Tuesday, saying he has no knowledge of Buffett’s motivation for selling.

“I don’t know what exactly he’s doing, because frankly, we can’t ask him. We wouldn’t ask,” he said during Barclays Global Financial Services Conference, according to a transcript on FactSet. “But on the other hand, the market’s absorbing the stock .... we’re buying a portion of the stock, and so life will go on.”

Shares of BofA have dipped just about 1% since the start of July, and the stock is up 16.7% this year, slightly outperforming the S&P 500.

Moynihan, who has been leading the bank since 2010, praised the 94-year-old’s shrewd investment in his bank in 2011, which helped shore up confidence in the embattled lender struggling with losses tied to subprime mortgages.

“He’s been a great investor for our company, and stabilized our company when we needed at the time,” he said.

To illustrate how lucrative Buffett’s investment has been, Moynihan said if investors were to buy his bank stock the same day Buffett did, they would have been able to capture the low price of $5.50 per share. The stock last traded just under $40 apiece.

“He just had the guts to do it in a big way. And he did it. And it’s been a fabulous return for him. We’re happy that he gets it,” Moynihan said.

Chatgpt says its new AI can reason like a person -- which stocks benefit from this?,"Three points of discussion:

* If these claims are true, which stocks will benefit most? I know Chatgpt used mostly NVIDIA chips in the beginning, but are they also considering other chips from Google, AMD, Tesla? Or maybe it's something in the energy or liquid cooling sector?

* How big will the impact be on these stocks? Is it already ""priced in""?

* For the new AI itself, how much do you believe in the new claims of human like intelligence? 

Source: [CNN via Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chatgpt-maker-says-ai-model-113626666.html).

>“We trained these models to spend more time thinking through problems before they respond, much like a person would,” the maker of ChatGPT said on its website. “Through training, they learn to refine their thinking process, try different strategies and recognize their mistakes.”

> As examples of the new models’ power, OpenAI noted that they can be used by healthcare researchers to annotate cell sequencing data and by physicists to generate “complicated mathematical formulas needed for quantum optics.”

> The potential of the new AI models was also highlighted by Noam Brown, a research scientist at the company. “OpenAI’s o1 thinks for seconds, but we aim for future versions to think for hours, days, even weeks. **Inference costs will be higher**,” he posted on X Thursday, referring to the costs — such as higher energy bills — of using AI to make inferences from inputs. “But what cost would you pay for a new cancer drug? For breakthrough batteries?” he added.

"Oracle trails only Nvidia among large-cap tech this year, as Ellison closes in on Bezos","Larry Ellison turned 80 last month. It’s been a celebratory year.

While fellow legacy tech players Intel and Cisco struggle to find their footing in a world driven increasingly by the promise of artificial intelligence, Oracle has emerged as a Wall Street darling.

Following a better-than-expected [earnings report](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/09/oracle-orcl-q1-earnings-report-2025.html) after the close on Monday, the stock popped 11% on Tuesday. It gained more steam on Wednesday, closing at a record $157.10. Oracle has seen double-digit gains following each of its three quarterly reports this year, driven by the company’s cloud businesses. The stock didn’t have a single double-digit increase last year and had only one in 2022.

“The excitement is back,” Guggenheim analysts titled their post-earnings report, highlighting “momentum across all business.”

Oracle shares are now up 49% this year, trailing only AI chipmaker Nvidia — up 136% — among large-cap tech stocks. The next best performer in the group is Meta, which has gained 45%.

Intel, meanwhile, has lost 60% of its value and Cisco is down almost 3%. Both companies announced major layoffs in their earnings reports last month.

The biggest financial winner from Oracle’s rally is Ellison, who founded the software company in 1977 and remains chairman. He owns over 40% of the outstanding stock and has seen his net worth swell to $192 billion, according to Forbes. Only Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($251 billion) and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ($202 billion) are wealthier.

By the standards of high-growth tech, Oracle remains fairly plodding.

Revenue increased 8% in the latest quarter from a year earlier to $13.31 billion. For the current period, growth is expected to be between 8% and 10%, CEO Safra Catz said on the earnings call.

Since 2011, Oracle has had only one year of double-digit revenue growth — 18% in fiscal 2023 — and four times the company has contracted.

“After 13 years of single-digit organic total revenue growth, Oracle is reaccelerating into the double digits,” JMP analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday, bumping up their rating to buy from hold. “We remain very EPS confident and committed to full-year total revenue growth growing double digits.”

Oracle is currently in the midst of its CloudWorld conference, which wraps up on Thursday in Las Vegas. Between the earnings report and the annual event, investors are applauding the company’s cloud story, including both its infrastructure business and its databases.

While Oracle is still way behind Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google in terms of cloud infrastructure market share, the business has turned into a big growth driver for the company. Revenue in the unit surged 45% in the quarter from a year earlier to $2.2 billion.

In addition to competing with the top cloud companies, Oracle is increasingly partnering with them.

A year ago, Ellison visited Microsoft’s headquarters outside of Seattle for the first time, announcing a collaboration with a company he’d competed with for more than 30 years.

On Monday, Oracle said its database software will become available for AWS customers to use atop Oracle hardware sitting inside of Amazon data centers. Oracle has forged such arrangements with all three major cloud infrastructure vendors in the past year.

“We believe our cloud partnerships with AWS and Microsoft and Google will turbocharge the growth of our database business for years to come,” Ellison said on Monday’s earnings call.

Oracle didn’t immediately provide a comment for this story.

# ‘No more passwords’

For years, Ellison described Oracle’s database as “autonomous,” playing into the hype around self-driving cars (he used to be on Tesla’s board and is close with Musk) and the emergence of AI. Its product wouldn’t need manual patching and wouldn’t have downtime, and Ellison said no other cloud provider could do it. But of late he’s benefitted from playing nice.

After years of criticizing AWS at events, Ellison decided to ensure that clients are able to use Amazon’s market-leading cloud with Oracle’s full-featured database.

“Of course, customers have been able to use Oracle inside of AWS for a long time,” AWS CEO Matt Garman told CNBC in a recent interview. But the new offering will allow clients to easily sign up in the AWS marketplace of third-party software, make backups and move data to AWS analytics tools, Garman said.

Garman, who replaced Adam Selipsky as AWS CEO in June, added that clients had been asking the two companies to figure out how to work more closely together.

As Ellison digs deeper into AI and enters his 81st year on the planet, he’s now taking on passwords, which he calls “utterly ridiculous” because they’re insecure and can be “easily hacked.”

“This is the way log-on is going to work,” Ellison said on the earnings call. “I’m going to type in Larry.Ellison@oracle.com, the computer is going to look at me and say, ‘OK, Hi Larry.’ We’re done.”

He went on to say that Catz can recognize him as can his kids, so there’s no reason his computer shouldn’t be able to the same.

“No more passwords,” he said. “Those have got to go.”

Consumer prices rose 0.2% in August with core inflation higher than expected,"The consumer price index climbed 2.5% year over year in August, according to data released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, this was in line with the last-minute downward-revised forecasts at 2.5% (previous forecasts at 2.6%).

So, Fed can go ahead with the 50bps rate cut next week? In my opinion, 25bps will be more realistic after this CPI release \~ but let's see.

*Prices increased as expected in August while the annual inflation rate declined to its lowest level since February 2021, according to a Labor Department report Wednesday that sets the stage for an expected quarter percentage point rate cut from the Federal Reserve in a week.*  
  
*The consumer price index, a broad measure of goods and services costs across the U.S. economy, increased 0.2% for the month, in line with the Dow Jones consensus, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported.*  
  
*That put the 12-month inflation rate at 2.5%, down 0.4 percentage point from the July level and compared to the estimate for 2.6%.*  
  
*However, core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased 0.3% for the month, slightly higher than the 0.2% estimate. The 12-month core inflation rate was 3.2%, in line with the forecast.*  
  
*While the numbers showed that inflation slowly continued to moderate, housing-related costs remain an issue. The shelter component of CPI, which has about a one-third weighting in the index, increased 0.5%, accounting for much of the increase in the all-items measure. The shelter index was up 5.2% year over year.*  
  
*Food prices rose just 0.1%, while energy costs slid 0.8%.*  
  
*Elsewhere in the report, used vehicle prices decreased 1%, medical care services declined 0.1% and apparel prices increased 0.3%.*  
  
*Stock market futures moved lower following the report though Treasury yields spiked.*  
  
*In the fed funds futures market, traders priced in an 85% chance that the Federal Open Market Committee will approve a quarter percentage point, or 25 basis point, interest rate reduction when its meeting concludes Sept. 18, according to the CME Group″s FedWatch measure.*",319,83,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fe8ze8/consumer_prices_rose_02_in_august_with_core/,consumer price index climbed year year august according data released wednesday bureau labor statistic line lastminute downwardrevised forecast previous forecast fed go ahead bps rate cut next week opinion bps realistic cpi release let see xb consumer price rose august core inflation higher expected xb price increased expected august annual inflation rate declined lowest level since february according labor department report wednesday set stage expected quarter percentage point rate cut federal reserve week consumer price index broad measure good service cost across u economy increased month line dow jones consensus bureau labor statistic reported put month inflation rate percentage point july level compared estimate however core cpi excludes volatile food energy price increased month slightly higher estimate month core inflation rate line forecast number showed inflation slowly continued moderate housingrelated cost remain issue shelter component cpi onethird weighting index increased accounting much increase allitems measure shelter index year year food price rose energy cost slid elsewhere report used vehicle price decreased medical care service declined apparel price increased stock market future moved lower following report though treasury yield spiked fed fund future market trader priced chance federal open market committee approve quarter percentage point basis point interest rate reduction meeting concludes sept according cme group fedwatch measure,consumer price rose in august with core inflation higher than expected,consumer price rose in august with core inflation higher than expected consumer price index climbed year year august according data released wednesday bureau labor statistic line lastminute downwardrevised forecast previous forecast fed go ahead bps rate cut next week opinion bps realistic cpi release let see xb consumer price rose august core inflation higher expected xb price increased expected august annual inflation rate declined lowest level since february according labor department report wednesday set stage expected quarter percentage point rate cut federal reserve week consumer price index broad measure good service cost across u economy increased month line dow jones consensus bureau labor statistic reported put month inflation rate percentage point july level compared estimate however core cpi excludes volatile food energy price increased month slightly higher estimate month core inflation rate line forecast number showed inflation slowly continued moderate housingrelated cost remain issue shelter component cpi onethird weighting index increased accounting much increase allitems measure shelter index year year food price rose energy cost slid elsewhere report used vehicle price decreased medical care service declined apparel price increased stock market future moved lower following report though treasury yield spiked fed fund future market trader priced chance federal open market committee approve quarter percentage point basis point interest rate reduction meeting concludes sept according cme group fedwatch measure,positive
Large option activity at close - signal bearish/ bullish signal? ,"I follow stocks and often watch the option activity online

A few weeks ago, I was watching LRCX when it dropped from $870 to $820. After the drop, I noticed that end of day there was a large number of put options bought that then brought LRCX down to $800 and even further to $715 range the following weeks

I noticed today that someone bought a large number of call options at last 15 min of close for NXST. I am going to watch as they have dropped in price the past week with rest of market somewhat rebounding. 

When large option positions are bought, it tends to drive the price up for the short period. However, both the above mentioned stocks have low volume. Does that implicate that they are being used as leverage for potential market price swings in a broader market?

Accidentally created wash sale,"I have been dabbling in LETFs for a bit but never really day traded or played options on it up until recently. I sold covered calls on SOXL, got the shares assigned .. didn't really know about rolling options up until now ended up losing those shares. I day-traded a bit after and long story short now I have a disallowed loss of about 50k. In addition I have a realized gains of about 75k. What does this mean?

Does this mean that if I have an additional profit of upto 50k on SOXL, it would cancel out against the disallowed loss? I.E. my end of the year realized gains would only be 75k (if I don't have additional losses)

Or am I screwed, and any additional profit I might have I would have to pay taxes on them on top of my realized gains of 75K?

Any help here would be appreciated.

# [Stock futures rise as investors brace for more inflation and labor data: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/11/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures inched higher Thursday as investors brace for more inflation and labor data, following a volatile session spurred by the release of the August consumer price index.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 64 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 futures gained nearly 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.1%.
*****
> Nvidia shares climbed 0.9% higher in premarket trading, continuing the chipmaker’s rally that almost singlehandedly led Wednesday’s market turnaround after CEO Jensen Huang touted the company’s “great” demand.
*****
> Investors are coming off a choppy trading session session that saw a late-day advance in tech shares help the major benchmarks rebound from their lows. The S&P 500 ended the day higher by 1.07%, even after falling more than 1% on an intraday basis — a first for the broader index since October 2022.
*****
> At the same time, the 30-stock Dow gained 124.75 points, or 0.31%, after losing as much as 743.89 points earlier in the session. The Nasdaq Composite closed 2.17% higher, making a comeback from a decline of more than 1%.
*****
> Stocks dropped earlier in the day when August’s consumer price index showed an uptick in core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices. The reading spooked investors hoping for a half-percentage point cut from the Federal Reserve at its Sept. 17-18 meeting.
*****
> “The inflation report that we saw today is confirming a trend that we’ve acknowledged over the past couple of months, where now that the Fed is — and I think appropriately so — focused less on inflation and more on economic growth, that completely changes market reactivity,” Lauren Goodwin, chief market strategist at New York Life Investments, told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Wednesday.
*****
> “It means that now good economic news — and I would include today’s inflation report as relatively good news, a little stronger than the markets were expecting — that’s going to be good news for the market,” Goodwin continued.
*****
> Wall Street is anticipating the release of the August producer price index on Thursday. Economists polled by Dow Jones anticipate a rise of 0.2% last month in the headline and core readings, up from 0.1% and 0.0% previously.
*****
> Initial jobless claims data for the week ending Sept. 7 is also on deck, and is expected to have slid to 225,000, down from 227,000 the previous week, according to Dow Jones.
*****
> On the earnings front, Kroger is slated to report results before the open on Thursday. Adobe will release its quarterly report after the close.

"GameStop reports fall in revenue, files for 20 million share offering","(Reuters) -GameStop said on Tuesday it had filed for an offering of up to 20 million shares, sending its stock down more than 10% in extended trading after the videogame retailer's second-quarter revenue fell as consumers continued to switch to online buying.

The company, which has been at the center of a ""meme stock"" trading frenzy, is struggling with declining sales in its primary business of selling new and used video game discs due to a shift to digital downloads, game streaming, and e-commerce shopping.

GameStop said it intends to use the proceeds from the offering ""for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions and investments in a manner consistent with our investment policy.""

The company is also identifying stores for closure and expects to shut down more outlets than it did in the past few years, it said on Tuesday, in-line with comments made by CEO Ryan Cohen in June.

Cohen warned of intense competition in the gaming console market earlier this year.

Analysts at Wedbush said on Friday GameStop continues to face a near insurmountable barrier to its planned return to growth as streaming services proliferate, while the company shows a total lack of any strategy to enter new categories with growth potential.

Shares of GameStop have seen significant volatility this year after online stock influencer Roaring Kitty returned to X.com following a three-year hiatus, with a cryptic meme that was widely seen as a bullish signal for GameStop.

Roaring Kitty was a key player in the 2021 rally in GameStop and other so-called meme stocks that was fueled by individual investors on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum.

GameStop reported revenue of $798.3 million for the quarter ended Aug. 3 compared with $1.16 billion a year earlier. Two analysts polled by LSEG were expecting revenue of $895.7 million.

Its net income stood at $14.8 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with a loss of $2.8 million, or 1 cent per share, a year earlier. This was helped by a 16% fall in the company's selling and administrative expenses in the quarter.

Is there any info that can be learned from afterhour stock prices?  ,"There's a few stocks that I've been following where I've noticed afterhours has had much higher trading prices compared to the normal hours.  I'm talking spikes of 4-5% higher in afterhours whereas it's been relatively flat during normal hours.  I've been noticing this pattern for the past week and I'm wondering if this is an indication of anything?  I understand trading after hours has significantly lower volume and thus there can be higher volatility spikes in the prices.  But in this case, I've only seen the price spikes be a lot higher and never lower.  Why would anyone buy shares afterhours at a 5% premium when they could have paid a lot less during normal hours?  And why would this be happening consistently over the last week?

Amazon passed Google as 4th largest in S&P 500,"“Amazon stock was rising on Tuesday, just enough to maintain its place as the S&P 500’s fourth-largest company by market value after overtaking Alphabet on Monday. It may owe Oracle a little bit of a thank you.

Shares of Amazon.com were up 2.6% at 2:09 p.m. on Monday, after rising 2.3% on Monday. With Monday’s move, Amazon passed Alphabet as the fourth-largest company in the U.S. for the first time since April 5. Alphabet’s stock has fallen 8.7% in September, while Amazon is off just 0.7%. Amazon’s market cap was $22 billion more than Alphabet’s at Monday’s close, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Amazon had some good news for investors at an investor conference, noting that its cloud business, AWS, is gaining further traction in AI but that it’s also focused on “balancing expenditures with revenue growth,” according to BofA analyst Justin Post.

There was also good news from Oracle’s earnings. Yes, most of the good news was for Oracle stock, which has risen 12% on Thursday. But with the release of its earnings, Oracle and AWS said that they had come together with a new cloud product, Oracle Database@AWS. Oracle already has partnerships with Microsoft’s Azure and Google, but Post notes that the AWS/Oracle deal should be good for both companies. “Oracle & AMZN had been competitive for database customers, so new partnership suggests companies have a lot to gain by working together,” he writes.

Right now investors will just settle for gains.”

QXO a good long term investment?,"1) QXO, Inc. operates as a business application, technology, and consulting company in North America. They provide a long list on technology related services and so I thinks they won't be going out of business any time soon as the world only gets more dependent on tech. 

2)  the management although they are really old they have a good track record.

3) the stock went up 40% in the last month, I know it doesn't mean much but as the stock price hit rock bottom recently, I thought it could only go up from there.

What do you think about this? I'm a beginner so I want more perspectives.

AI in Control?,"I am new to investing, but have been paying a lot of attention to the market and my investments since the beginning of this year. A combination of events has caused me to wonder at some things and I was curious if I am on target or off target in my thinking.

I have been paying attention also to AI and I’m thinking about the time that it became better at the game Go than humans. One of the elements of that situation that has stuck out in my mind is that the machines were reported to play go very differently than human competitors to a degree that the humans couldn’t understand, at least initially, the strategy.

Is it possible that there is enough control of enough money in the market by AI that the AI systems are now playing the market like they played Go? That could explain what, to me, looks like strange and unpredictable movement in the market. It is conceivable, for me at least, that the machines, if optimized a certain way or focused on certain outcomes, could create movements in the market that produced greater wealth for those employing them by, triggering sell off’s after selling high and then buying back in lower or many more things that I can’t even imagine.

What would I do next Wednesday if I am in Jerome Powell's position?,"Would I do a 25 basis points or 50 basis points cut?

1. I could go with a 25 bp cut as the most recent CPI is at 2.5% YOY, and unemployment is not terrible.  Hoping the affect of starting a rate cut in September with subsequent two more 25 bp cuts before the end of the year be enough to get the inflationary rate down to 2% in the next 12 months and not lower.  Lower inflation rate can risk into a deflation with the economy going to recession.
2. Going with a 50 bp cut in September to jump start the economy with two more 25 bp cuts before the end of this year to avoid possible deflation and ensure the economy won't spiral into a recession.
3. Going with a 25 bp cut in September and see how things go with the possibility of additional 50 bp and a 25 bp cuts before the end of the year, but that's take on some risk of the economy losing momentum by not having a 50 bp cut in September.

I would probably pick the second choice as I won't be sure how many more terms I would stay as the Fed Chairman and won't want to risk the economy to go into a recession and leaving my legacy in ruins.

But that's my opinion, and I am not Jerome Powell.

Apple loses EU court battle over 13 billion euro tax bill in Ireland ,"Europe’s top court on Tuesday ruled against Apple in the tech giant’s 10-year court battle over its tax affairs in Ireland.

The pronouncement from the European Court of Justice comes hours after Apple unveiled a swathe of new product offerings, looking to revitalize its iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPod line-ups.

CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment. The company’s shares were down 1% in premarket trading at 09:07 a.m. London time.

In 2014, the European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, opened an investigation into Apple’s tax payments in Ireland, the tech giant’s headquarters in the EU.

The Commission in 2016 ordered Dublin to recover up to 13 billion euros ($14.4 billion) in back taxes from Apple, at the time saying that the tech company had received “illegal” tax benefits from Ireland over the course of two decades.

Apple and Ireland appealed the Commission’s decision in 2019, and in 2020 the EU General Court sided with the U.S. tech giant. The EU’s second-highest court anulled the Commission’s 2016 decision and said that the executive arm did not prove that the Irish government had given Apple a tax advantage.

The Commission in turn appealed the General Court’s decision, sending the litigation up to the ECJ.

The case, which first began under outgoing competition chief Margrethe Vestager, highlights the continued conflict between U.S. tech giants and the EU, which has sought to tackle issues from data protection to taxation and antitrust.

This was not the last time that Apple found itself in the EU’s crosshairs. Most recently, the Commission hit the iPhone maker hit Apple with an antitrust fine of 1.8 billion euro ($1.99 billion) in March for abusing its dominant position in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.

Separately, the EU’s sweeping Digital Markets Act has forced companies to change some of their practices in Europe. The Commission has opened various investigations under the DMA into tech giants, including Apple, Alphabet and Meta.

*****
> U.S. stock futures slipped Wednesday as investors looked toward the August consumer inflation report.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 100 points, or nearly 0.3%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures each dipped about 0.1%.
*****
> The CPI report and Thursday’s producer price index could help determine the size of a widely expected rate cut at the end of the Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting on Sept. 18. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect the headline CPI to have risen 0.2% from the previous month and 2.6% from a year earlier.
*****
> Fed funds futures trading suggests a 69% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut and a 31% likelihood of a 50-basis-point reduction, according to CME’s FedWatch Tool.
*****
> “I think what we’re going to see next week is a Fed that gives us a 25-basis-point rate cut because to give us a 50-basis-point cut will set off alarm bells and would also be an admission of guilt,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco, on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
> “I don’t think that the Fed keeping us at very restrictive monetary policy levels for a long time creates damage that is irreparable, but I do believe every day that we have rates at these levels the odds of a recession increase,” Hooper added.

JPMorgan shares drop 7% after bank cuts guidance on interest income and expenses ,"JPMorgan Chase shares fell 7% Tuesday after the bank’s president told analysts that expectations for net interest income and expenses in 2025 were too optimistic.

While the bank expects to be in the “ballpark” of the 2024 target for NII of about $91.5 billion, the current estimate for 2025 of about $90 billion “is not very reasonable” because the Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates, JPMorgan president Daniel Pinto said at financial conference.

“I think that that number will be lower,” Pinto said. He declined to give a specific figure.

The stock move was the New York-based bank’s worst drop since June 2020, according to FactSet. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, has been a winner among lenders in recent years, benefiting from better-than-expected growth in NII as the bank gathered more deposits and made more loans than expected. But skittish investors are now concerned about the outlook for a bellwether banking stock.

NII, one of the main ways banks make money, is the difference in the cost of a bank’s deposits and what it earns by lending money or investing it in securities. When interest rates decline, new loans made by the bank and new bonds it purchases will yield less.

Falling rates can help banks in the sense that customers will slow the rotation out of checking accounts and into higher-yielding instruments like CDs or money market funds. But they also make new assets lower yielding, which complicates the picture.

“Clearly, as rates go lower, you have less pressure on repricing of deposits,” Pinto said. “But as you know, we are quite asset sensitive.”

When it comes to expenses, the analyst estimate for next year of roughly $94 billion “is also a bit too optimistic” because of lingering inflation and new investments the firm is making, Pinto said.

“There are a bunch of components that tell us that probably the number on expenses will be a bit higher than what is expected at the moment,” Pinto said.

"Boeing delivers 40 jets in August, up 5 from a year ago","Sept 10 (Reuters) - Boeing (BA.N), opens new tab said on Tuesday it delivered 40 commercial jets in August, up five from the same month in 2023 when it struggled with a manufacturing defect on its 737 MAX, as the U.S. planemaker eyes higher output under new CEO Kelly Ortberg.

Boeing has pledged to boost production of its strongest selling jet, the MAX, to 38 per month by year's end.

But the planemaker faces obstacles such as a possible strike as early as Friday by more than 32,000 Seattle-area and Portland factory workers who vote on a new deal Sept. 12.

The U.S. planemaker is operating a slower assembly line since a Jan. 5 in-flight blowout, opens new tab of a door plug on a 737 MAX 9 jet that heightened regulatory scrutiny.

Boeing handed over 32 MAX jets to customers last month, including nine deliveries to customers in China, the most since December 2019.

Boeing delivered 43 commercial jets in July, including 31 MAX jets.

Investors closely watch delivery numbers, as airplane makers receive the majority of payment for an aircraft when it is transferred to a customer.

After adjustments to reflect the backlog, Boeing reported adjusted net orders for the month of 24.

That brought Boeing's gross order total so far this year through August 31 to 250. After removing cancellations and conversions, Boeing posted a net total of 207 orders since the start of 2024.

Following further accounting adjustments, Boeing reported adjusted net orders of 122 airplanes so far this year.

Year to date through August 31, Boeing delivered 258 airplanes, including 198 MAX jets.

European rival Airbus (AIR.PA), opens new tab said last week it had delivered 47 aircraft in August, down from 77 in July, to reach 447 so far this year.

Goldman Sachs to post $400 million hit to third quarter on consumer unwind ,"Goldman Sachs will post a roughly $400 million pretax hit to third-quarter results as the bank continues to unwind its ill-fated consumer business.

CEO David Solomon said Monday at a conference that by unloading Goldman’s GM Card business, as well as a separate portfolio of loans, the bank would post a hit to revenues when it reports results next month.

It is the latest turbulence related to Solomon’s push into consumer retail. In late 2022, Goldman began to pivot away from its nascent consumer operations, beginning a series of write-downs related to selling chunks of the business. Goldman’s credit card business, in particular its Apple Card, allowed rapid growth in retail lending, but also led to losses and friction with regulators.

Goldman is instead focusing on asset and wealth management to help drive growth. The bank was in talks to sell the GM Card platform to Barclays, The Wall Street Journal reported in April.

Solomon also said Monday that trading revenue for the quarter was headed for a 10% decline because of a tough year-over-year comparison and difficult trading conditions in August for fixed-income markets.
